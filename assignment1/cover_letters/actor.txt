To Whom It May Concern,

I read about your online posting for Actors for a new film in town and would love to be considered for a part. I have been working toward my dream of becoming a full-time Actor for years now, and a role in your Cloud Clearwater Productions film could be the vital next step in my journey.
My love of acting developed at an early age. I was on the stage as soon as I could walk. I starred in films as a young child when I was in middle school as well as high school. I took part in local town performances as well. Once I attended school at Hawaii Western, my acting took a turn. I majored in Theater Arts, really putting my skills and passion to the test.
Besides performing in plays through school, I also continued to monitor for local performances and opportunities. I take pride in admitting the parts I gained over the years from college to today. I was fortunate enough to star in three major productions: “Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat,” “Othello,” and a version of “The Lion King” that showed my stage athleticism.
I have also played key parts in plays and films that didn’t include a starring role. Side and complementary characters are often just as important to the execution of a story as the main character is. They often bring the problem and/or the climax. They can aid the hero in reaching a goal. Oftentimes, the ultimate success or failure of a project depends on the supporting cast, and I know this intimately. I hope to be a part of that cast in your endeavor to show just what I can do.
