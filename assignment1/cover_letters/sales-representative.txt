Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Sales Representative position at Retail Ocean. As an educated and experienced marketer, I believe I can exceed your expectations and increase sales for Retail Ocean.
My tenure at TradeLot proved to be a successful one. From day one I only gave my best. On the sales floor, I used many well-known marketing strategies as well as a few of my own techniques. During my first year, I increased sales on a product which had previously had not been selling very well by 50%. By my second year, I was a top five sales representative for TradeLot. Because of my success, I was able to attend several conferences, where I networked and learned new sales strategies from world-renowned experts. My demeanor as a sales representative is not pushy or “salesy.” I believe that if a product will truly benefit a customer, then it is my duty to make them see how. I take time to learn about the customer and match them with a product that is best suited to their needs.
Ever since I was a child I have been interested in sales. I was always coming up with “products” to sell to my friends and family. From lemonade stands to peddling candy and duct tape wallets, I was born to sell. I saw school fundraisers as an opportunity to play salesperson even though I didn’t make any money from it. I loved the rush of getting a customer to say yes to a product. In 2012, I graduated with my degree in Marketing from Coral Springs University.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Retail Ocean.
