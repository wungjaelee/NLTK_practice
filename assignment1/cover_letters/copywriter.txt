Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with great pleasure that I’m applying for the Copywriter position at River Tech. I have been writing clear, engaging and effective copy for clients in a corporate setting for the last eight years. I look forward to bringing my talent for creating compelling copy to River Tech. I thrive on a busy schedule, and I love focusing my energy on completing assignments before the deadline.
In my previous role as a Retail Ocean Copywriter, I was part of a staff of three, and we had projects that were team-oriented as well as many that were individually assigned to us. I often bounced ideas off of others and was praised for my ability to accept criticism and adjust my copy accordingly. I was also commended for being a source of ideas and advice. My copywriting team worked as part of a larger creative team, coordinating with graphic artists so that text and visuals would be in harmony.
My experience in creating copy is varied; I have created headlines, ad copy, blog posts, webpage copy and white papers. I love writing pithy, short taglines that will grab a potential customer’s attention quickly. I’m also skilled at creating persuasive white papers that will engage a reader on a rational level.
I appreciate the time that you are taking to consider me as a Copywriter for River Tech. I look forward to learning more about the company, and I am excited to hear more about the types of copy that River Tech will need.
