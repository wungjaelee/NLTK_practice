Dear Hiring Manager:

I am applying for the Legal Intern position at Crane & Jenkins, LLP. As a J.D. candidate at Hawaii Western University, Iâ€™m eager to take on a summer position. I work quickly and efficiently and take pride in making sure that all my work is organized. I can create content and complete tasks well before deadlines. I am intrigued by the idea of using my organizational and writing skills to help Crane & Jenkins, LLP achieve their goal of seeking justice for clients.
I served as a Research Assistant at Cloud Clearwater Law Center. I researched current laws and oversights, assisted with organizing conferences, and edited material prior to publication. At the end of my time at the center I compiled my research into a report and presented it to staff members. The report has since been used to modify legal strategies, and materials that I edited have gotten national recognition in the area of international law.
I have experience writing in a variety of forms and deciphering complex and data-driven information. I am also skilled at rhetoric and public speaking and can apply both to any legal situation. I live for helping others, from legal staff to clients, and enjoy carrying out both on a professional level. With a goal to double research on legal practices in the United Kingdom by 50% at Cloud Clearwater Law Center, I exceeded that target and increased UK research by 70% in five months.
Attached are my resume and letters of recommendation. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about the Legal Intern position at Crane & Jenkins, LLP.
