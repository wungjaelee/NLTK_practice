Dear Hiring Manager,

I am not just another young adult looking for a job at a coffee shop. I live and breathe coffee, and I absolutely adore Cloud Clearwater. I am excited to apply for the Barista opening at Cloud Clearwater because I am passionate about foam, caffeine, and smiling, and I love the inviting atmosphere.
At my last position as Barista for the coffee shop at Retail Ocean, I perfected our signature coffee swirl in a record two weeks. In 14 days, I learned to not only make the lattes themselves but also craft an absolutely perfect Retail Ocean wave atop the steaming cup, and I know that I could quickly learn to craft any foam creation for this new position. Beyond that, I would love to branch out from my coffee interests to pastries, teas, and the other menu items offered at Cloud Clearwater.
I am outgoing, extroverted, and would easily blend with the already vibrant staff employed with Cloud Clearwater. I work extremely well under pressure, and I am able to grin on cue despite the morning and evening rushes that might stress some people out. In addition to all of these skills, I also have a fantastic memory and have been known to memorize drink orders to faces, therefore speeding up clogged lines. Along with these behind-the-counter talents, I am also dedicated to the tasks that arenâ€™t coffee related too. Stocking can be fun, and I would love to join the team to be the Barista you need when you need it!
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. I can be reached at either sflores@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
