Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Property Manager position at Retail Ocean, a trusted name in home rentals. As an upbeat professional with over 10 years of property management experience, I am confident in my ability to perform at Retail Ocean.
During my tenure as Property Manager for Crane & Jenkins, my responsibilities included calculating rental rates for our homes, advertising, showing homes to potential tenants, collecting rent, creating an annual budget, contracting repairs when needed and enforcing company policies. I interacted with clients and tenants in a professional manner and made sure to address any concerns as quickly as possible.
Before I worked at Crane & Jenkins, I helped my father manage properties for his small business. He had 10 properties when I was 12. As his business expanded to over 30 homes and I grew up, I became more involved in helping him manage properties. He taught me how to interact with tenants and taught me what to do and what not to do when a tenant damages property or is behind on rent. I believe that a Property Manager should always be considerate of the needs of their tenants. My father never allowed a repair to go unaddressed. If a tenant called and said something was broken, he made sure to get someone to the property as soon as possible. I carry that same sense of urgency in my work.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Retail Ocean and its clients.
