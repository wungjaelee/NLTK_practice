Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing in regard to your Nursing Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins. I am a dedicated and compassionate individual who strives to provide the best care I possibly can to patients. Iâ€™m excited by the prospect of working for a highly recognized long-term care facility like Crane & Jenkins, and I believe that my patient care skills make me a natural fit for this position.
Despite being a recent graduate of the Nursing Assistant program, I have experience working with patients in the capacity of Patient Care and Nursing Assistant. Before enrolling in the Nursing Assistant program, I worked at River Tech for three years, which allowed me to gain knowledge, skills and understanding of the needs of patients. I passed the Nursing Assistant competency exam to earn the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) credential.
I have experience performing Nursing Assistant duties, including feeding, grooming and bathing patients while helping them with their other basic care needs. I assist the nurses with their daily duties when needed. My compassion for patients, along with my ability to communicate well with them, has always made me an asset in the workplace. I feel that my patient-driven approach, CNA skills and desire to learn new roles will also make me an asset to Crane & Jenkins.
Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting and speaking with you so I can learn more about the position and Crane & Jenkins. I believe that face-to-face meetings can be very beneficial to both parties. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at your convenience.
