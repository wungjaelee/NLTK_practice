Dear Hiring Manager,

Thank you for taking the time to review my application for the Esthetician position at Cloud Clearwater Salon. As an experienced, service-oriented professional with more than a decade of experience working in boutique salons, I thrive on creating a welcoming environment for all clients and providing the highest quality skincare services. I am confident that my technical skills and my talent for encouraging repeat business will allow me to help Cloud Clearwater Salon grow its skincare department.
At River Tech Beauty, I was responsible for providing a full range of cosmetic services, including laser hair and skin procedures, waxing, body treatments and cosmetics applications. I am a fully certified Esthetician and have received extensive training in the latest techniques for facial skincare, including Hydrofacials, chemical peels, and microdermabrasion. My specialized training, along with my interpersonal skills, has helped me become adept at developing long-term, trusted relationships that help to build a loyal client base. I was consistently ranked as the top employee for repeat and referral business and received scores of 98% or higher on client satisfaction surveys.
In addition to providing outstanding skincare service to clients, I was also responsible for training and leading all new salon hires. I developed a comprehensive training curriculum that covered skincare service techniques, administrative duties, and client relationship development. This training program resulted in 10% higher scores on customer satisfaction surveys and a 33% improvement in new employee retention.
Thank you for considering me for the Esthetician position at Cloud Clearwater Salon. I’m eager to discuss how my unique skills and talents can be used to provide enormous value for Cloud Clearwater’s discerning clientele.
