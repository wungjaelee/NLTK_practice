Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an upbeat, high-energy professional. I am excited to be applying for the Restaurant Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. As someone with over 10 years of restaurant management experience, it is an honor to be applying to one of LA’s most prestigious restaurants.
My previous Restaurant Manager position was held at Retail Ocean. During my 13-year tenure, I became experienced and came in to work each day wanting to perform better than I did the previous one. My responsibilities included coordinating the front and back of the house, responding to customer complaints, maximizing customer satisfaction, supervising and scheduling shifts, providing employee feedback, taking inventory, and maintaining sanitation and safety protocols at all times.
I grew up in a restaurant. My father owned one of the most popular restaurants in our small town. When I wasn’t in school, I was at the restaurant, bussing tables, rolling silverware, doing dishes, and hosting. I knew that restaurant like the back of my hand. I even waited tables on a few occasions when we were short-staffed. After high school, I decided to study culinary arts at Longford Tech. This gave me the platform I needed to become a Restaurant Manager. I truly have a love for food, people, and learning.
Thank you for your consideration of me as an applicant for the Restaurant Manager position. I look forward to hearing more about Cloud Clearwater.
