Dear Hiring Manager, 

I’m excited to be applying for the Marketer position at Crane & Jenkins. As a marketing manager with more than five years’ experience at leading agencies, I’ve cultivated a talent for developing creative and successful marketing strategies. I’m excited about combining my skills and my desire to serve the community with Crane & Jenkins’ extensive nonprofit client portfolio.
During my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I developed three of the agency’s top-producing advertising campaigns. My work included a rebranding campaign that generated a 57% increase in response rates, an email win-back strategy that netted more than $1 million in renewed accounts, and a CLIO-nominated mobile retargeting campaign for the company’s biggest client. I was commended by my manager for demonstrating strong skills in developing high-value client relationships, inspiring innovative creativity, and finding new ways to grow revenue in key target verticals.
As someone who has led more than 20 major digital marketing campaigns in the last two years, I understand the need to stay on top of the latest trends and remain adaptable in the rapidly changing digital marketing environment. I am strongly committed to continuing to refine my skills, and my passion for technology has kept me on the cutting edge of mobile marketing strategies.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Marketer position and about Crane & Jenkins. I believe my digital marketing skills will bring a competitive advantage to Crane & Jenkins, and I’m excited to meet with you and discuss how we can best work together.
