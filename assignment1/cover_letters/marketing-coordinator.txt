Dear Hiring Manager,

I believe in good products. More than that, I believe in making good products into good brands. How your brand is perceived can drastically impact how your product sells. That’s where I come in. I have a proven track record at reviving brands, and I want to put those skills to use at Retail Ocean. I believe Retail Ocean could be huge, and I believe I have the knowledge and skills to help the company reach its full potential as its new Marketing Coordinator.
At Coral Springs University, I majored in Marketing with a minor in Sales and Copywriting. While there, I became the lead columnist for our school paper, launching a new column called “Being the Brand” that featured different students and how they branded themselves for post-university life. Even in college, it became increasingly important to me to share the importance of brand awareness to the public, so I made it my mission to do so.
After graduating summa cum laude from Coral Springs, I held a year-long marketing internship with one of the best and the brightest minds in marketing while working for River Tech Industries. There, I honed my skills as a quick-witted and creative thinker, and now I am ready to start my very own marketing career under the umbrella of Retail Ocean. I believe with a little ingenuity, Retail Ocean can increase sales exponentially and leave a mark on the sales industry, and I am ready to roll my sleeves up and work until it happens.
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you to schedule an interview. I can be reached at either mrabb@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
