Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself as an applicant for the Server position at Cloud Clearwater, the tastiest seafood experience in Central Florida. As a caring and attentive person with a love for people and good food, I believe the Server position at Cloud Clearwater restaurant would allow me to effectively use my soft skills and my experience as a Server.
I have been a Server since high school. As a teenager, I began waiting tables at the local eatery, TradeLot Cafe, in my small town. Each Friday and Saturday night for four years, I would hit the dining room floor, serving over 100 customers a night. While most of them were friendly faces from around town coming out for a good time, I made sure that each time they came was a pleasant and enjoyable experience. I also served during college.
As a Server, I believe it is of high importance that the customer enjoys every aspect of their dining experience. As a graduate of Longford Tech, I am confident that I can be of great value to Cloud Clearwater and its customers. Throughout my education, I gained valuable knowledge of the restaurant industry.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the expectations and duties of a Server at Cloud Clearwater. I hope to utilize my education and work experience in your establishment.
