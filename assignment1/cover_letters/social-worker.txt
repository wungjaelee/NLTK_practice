Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited at the prospect of serving in the Social Worker Supervisor position at Cloud Clearwater Assisted Living. I have been working with the elderly in several settings, including as an assisted living social worker, for over 10 years, which will be an asset in understanding the needs of the residents. I also have experience in planning events for elderly residents and supervising fellow social workers.
As part of my previous role as a social worker, I coordinated weekly activities for residents, including Bingo night, outings to the local public gardens and museums, and a monthly night out to a favorite restaurant. I was also promoted to supervise interns. In this role, I enabled them to engage with the residents and grow professionally.
On eight out of my last nine performance appraisals, I have been praised for my concern for the residents and my ability to intuit when someone has a problem that they need help resolving. I am also regularly told by my current supervisor that I have an attention to detail in handling the finances for the outings. I am especially fond of making connections with people, ensuring that their needs are met, and I have found that efficiently handling finances is one of the most fundamental ways to ensure that residents’ needs are met.
I appreciate you taking the time to consider me for the position of Social Worker Supervisor at Cloud Clearwater. I also look forward to hearing more details about the position.
