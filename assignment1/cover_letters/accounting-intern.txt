Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for the Accounting Intern position at Crane & Jenkins for my capstone internship. As an accounting major, I’ve been looking forward to applying for an internship to experience accounting in the real world.
During my past four years at Coral Springs University, I have studied a wide range of subjects in-depth. I’ve studied subjects such as accounting information systems, auditing, cost accounting, computer information systems, economics, finance, and marketing. I believe that I have the strong mathematical abilities and accounting knowledge that it takes to be successful.
As an Accounting Intern for Crane & Jenkins, I have a strong mathematics background to bring to the table. In elementary school, I went to math camp each summer. I received almost every award possible for high-achieving math students. I even went to a special class once a week with my math-oriented peers. In high school, I took advanced placement math, became a math club member, and was dual-enrolled at the local community college, taking basic accounting courses. During my senior year, my math club competed in the annual Mathletes Competition in New York City. As the team captain, I led my team to victory.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to hearing more about Crane & Jenkins. I am excited to learn from experienced professionals in the accounting field and to discover what it’s like to be an accountant.
