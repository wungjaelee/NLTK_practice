Dear Hiring Manager,

As an experienced teacher with a passion for English and history, I thrive on finding creative and engaging ways to share the joys of learning. I’m excited by the opportunity to bring this enthusiasm to the Substitute Teacher position at Cloud Clearwater. I believe my skills and experience will help Cloud Clearwater’s students achieve their goals.
As a Substitute Teacher at River Tech for the past three years, I developed lesson plans, led class discussions and supervised extracurricular activities for the K-12 program. I excelled at creating interactive lesson plans, managing classrooms and encouraging students’ curiosity as they explored new ways to engage with their lesson material. In 2016, I was nominated for the district’s Educator of the Year. I was praised for developing creative, hands-on activities that encouraged a collaborative learning environment.
With more than six years of experience as a Substitute Teacher, I understand the challenges of taking charge of a new and unfamiliar classroom. I’m adept at grasping new course material, earning the respect of students, maintaining order in the classroom, and navigating the obstacles that naturally arise from a shift in students’ normal routines. I have been commended by school leadership for my ability to think on my feet, anticipate students’ needs and effectively address behavioral issues.
I’m excited about this opportunity and would be delighted to learn more about Cloud Clearwater’s Substitute Teacher position. I’m eager to discuss how my expertise as a certified English teacher can enrich the learning experience of students at Cloud Clearwater.
