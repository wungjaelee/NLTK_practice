Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for Crane & Jenkins’ Engineering Intern position. I am a third-year engineering student at Green Valley State University. My degree emphasis is in Civil Engineering, and I have completed 75% of my major’s requirements, including the required classes as outlined in your job description. What has motivated me to apply to this position is your firm’s participation in several key infrastructure projects near my home and the ability for this position to be a part of that work.
Last summer, I worked as an Engineering Intern for TradeLot, a large retail enterprise with locations across the United States. I worked directly with their small engineering team to develop structural and property plans for several of their franchises, and several of my designs were approved for their final planning stage. Although your job description prefers someone with an interest in both structural and property engineering, I have experience in both and am eager to continue in these lines of engineering work.
My academic accomplishments also exceed your requirements. I currently have a 3.9/4.0 GPA in all coursework and a 3.9/4.0 in my major. Earlier this year, my school’s engineering department recognized me as the top junior engineering student, which is also a reflection on my leadership, project, and teamwork skills. These traits will transfer to your internship position and make a noticeable contribution to Crane & Jenkins.
Thank you for reviewing my background in consideration for your internship opportunity. I would be encouraged to have the opportunity to meet with you to discuss more details of my coursework, prior internship, and other experiences relative to your position and company.
