Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for the Mechanical Engineer position at River Tech. I have an astute attention to detail that is required by the highest quality engineering professionals and look forward to working alongside some of the best STEM experts in the industry. My ability to grasp information quickly translates into shorter training periods and more productivity.
During my previous role as an engineering intern at Cloud Clearwater, I was tasked with developing a new filtration system that removed more than 99% of contaminants from even the most hazardous liquids. I worked on a team that was comprised of many different disciplines, which meant I needed to be cognizant of their respective expertise and know when to yield to their discretion. Working independently is also a strength of mine.
I have a strong work ethic, ability to handle multiple projects at once, and a yearning to never stop learning. Asking the right questions has also been a strong suit of mine so that the final product perfectly mirrors what the client is seeking to receive. Between my schooling at Coral Springs University and internship experience, I feel I am a highly qualified candidate for this position.
Thank you for your valuable time and consideration. I am sincerely looking forward to learning more details about the Mechanical Engineer position and about the great work that River Tech is conducting. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me in order to inquire further about any of my many qualifications listed on my resume. I look forward to speaking with you and the management team in the near future.
