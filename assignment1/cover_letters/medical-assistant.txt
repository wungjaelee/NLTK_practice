Dear Hiring Manager, 

I’m excited to be applying for the Medical Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. I am a certified AAMA Medical Assistant with more than six years of experience helping patients in a long-term care setting. I’m thrilled at the prospect of bringing my medical skills and my love for connecting with patients to Cloud Clearwater’s award-winning facility.
During my previous role at River Tech, I was primarily responsible for meeting the needs of patients in the memory care facility. In an effort to improve patient care, I pioneered a training program designed to educate staff and help them understand the care experience from the patient’s point of view. Not only did we see a 40% increase in client satisfaction ratings, but we also found a significant improvement in employee engagement and retention in this department.
I have extensive training in medical services as well as record management and office administration. Beyond these technical skills, I also pride myself on my ability to build deep relationships with the patients in my care. I received our facility’s prestigious Daisy Award in 2015 for excellence in patient care and have been praised by three River Tech department managers for my ability to multitask while still ensuring quality personal interactions with every patient and their families.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Medical Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. I am committed to continuing to grow as a medical service provider, and I’m confident that my skills and experience will make me a valuable addition to Cloud Clearwater’s outstanding team.
