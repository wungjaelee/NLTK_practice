Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Dental Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. As someone who is highly observant and intuitive, I have a strong talent for anticipating patients’ needs and creating a comfortable and pleasant dental environment. I am thrilled at the prospect of bringing my technical expertise and interpersonal skills to Cloud Clearwater’s thriving practice.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was given the opportunity to serve in a number of roles to help grow the company. In addition to providing excellent service to our patients, I was responsible for managing daily office administration tasks, including record management, insurance, billing, and supply inventory. In an effort to improve efficiency, I redesigned our inventory ordering and tracking system, which reduced duplicate ordering and resulted in a 10% overall cost reduction.
As someone with more than five years of dental assisting experience, I am deeply familiar with all aspects of patient care and the need to foster trusted relationships with every patient. I was commended by my manager for my chairside manner and my ability to put nervous patients at ease. I consistently received ratings of 98% or higher in client satisfaction feedback.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Dental Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. I would welcome the opportunity to join your team, and I look forward to speaking with you again about how my skills can benefit Cloud Clearwater.
