Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Data Analyst position at Cloud Clearwater. As someone with a lifetime love of relational mathematics and pattern recognition, I thrive on digging into complex data sets and producing insightful, data-driven strategic recommendations. I’m eager to turn my talent for analyzing big data into actionable growth strategies for Cloud Clearwater.
During my previous role at River Tech, I supported our sales, marketing and executive teams with recurring market insight reports and ad hoc data analysis. I pioneered the use of predictive modeling techniques to generate revenue forecasting reports with a high degree of accuracy, resulting in a 22% improvement in cash flow cycles. In addition to multiple commendations from senior leadership for developing successful Business Intelligence models, I was also nominated for the Rising Star Award at the prestigious 2016 Data, Analytics, & Insight Awards.
With more than eight years of experience as a professional Data Analyst, I am fluent in a wide variety of software and data management systems ranging from traditional options like Excel and MySQL to newer SaaS systems like Salesforce and Infusionsoft. I have a working knowledge of core programming skills, which has allowed me to develop over 100 custom reporting solutions within each of these data systems and deliver unique, innovative reports to executive leadership.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Data Analyst position and about Cloud Clearwater. I’m thrilled at the opportunity to use my expertise and experience to identify key data patterns and develop predictive models to help Cloud Clearwater achieve its strategic and operational goals.
