Dear Hiring Manager,

Iâ€™m excited to apply for the Registered Nursing position in the pediatric department at Cloud Clearwater. As a nursing student, I take great pride in learning about nursing. In my clinical training, I have worked with many patients and enjoy doing everything I can to aid in their healing and make them comfortable. During my clinical experiences, I most enjoyed working in pediatrics and would love to continue working with children.
At Longford Tech, I have worked hard in my coursework to learn everything I can. During my clinical experience, I worked in every department of the hospital. I became skilled in phlebotomy, medication administration and record-keeping. I have learned how to connect with each patient in a way that makes them feel more comfortable in the hospital, and I was able to communicate clearly with the doctors to ensure proper care for the patients I worked with.
My favorite assignment was in the pediatric department. During my time there, I was also able to work in the NICU, where I was able to help parents to bond with their infants. My most enjoyable experience working in the NICU was instructing and preparing first-time parents to take their children home. During this time, I was able to reassure and give them the tools they needed to care for their children at home.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the pediatric department at Cloud Clearwater. I believe that my schooling and clinical experience make me a good fit for this position. I look forward to increasing my skills as a Pediatric Nurse in order to give patients the best care possible.
