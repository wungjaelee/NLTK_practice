Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m delighted to be applying for the Paralegal position at Cloud Clearwater. This field has been a dream of mine ever since I visited a courtroom during a school field trip. I am especially excited about working at Cloud Clearwater because of the many diverse companies that you serve locally as well as internationally. This is in line with my career goals, which are to expand my knowledge in the Paralegal field into aspects of project management support in up-and-coming urban communities.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I managed and organized the legal documentation of mostly refurbished urban business entities. This included preparing formation documents, operating agreements, and resolutions. I also spent a majority of my time categorizing and indexing significant amounts of data within the historical legal files of the company, which led to a more concise and understandable filing system for the legal staff to utilize at a moment’s notice.
I am ready to take on more responsibility as a seasoned Paralegal with Cloud Clearwater as someone who has honed her self-management skills and readily follows through on tasks at hand and communications with colleagues and clients. I consider myself an asset as someone who is an active learner when it comes to information-gathering in a legal setting for meeting deadlines and future problem-solving.
Thank you for your time and consideration, and I am looking forward to learning more about your Paralegal position as well as Cloud Clearwater. As I have gained more knowledge and experience in my role thus far, I have also grown more confident in my abilities to contribute to a growing and diverse company such as Cloud Clearwater, and hope to join your thriving legal team of professionals.
