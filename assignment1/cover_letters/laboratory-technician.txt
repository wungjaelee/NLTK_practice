Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m very appreciative of the opportunity to apply for the Laboratory Technician position at Crane & Jenkins Research Institute. My career goal has always been to work in the science field, and I believe this opportunity lines up perfectly with my ambitions. Working in this particular field of study is very exciting, and I’m looking forward to learning more about this position.
During my employment at River Tech Testing, I worked in the laboratory for nine years and helped physicians perform technical diagnostic tests. My role also included collecting and recording extensive amounts of data. River Tech experienced sustained success during my tenure; the laboratory had a 15% increase in accuracy compared to the five years before my employment there. I enjoy the challenge of keeping detailed records and always following a meticulous pattern for achieving the most accurate results.
My passion for science motivated me to attend Coral Springs University as soon as I finished high school. I graduated with a bachelor’s of science degree and finished in the top 10% of my class. During my studies, I volunteered for many studies and received valuable experience in the lab testing field that prepared me for my future career. One of the studies involved testing DNA for a particular genetic disease, and my team was instrumental in helping the researchers identify the genes related to that specific disease.
Thank you for taking the time to read and review my cover letter for the Laboratory Technician position at Crane & Jenkins Research Institute. I believe that I am highly qualified for this job due to my past experience and educational background. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding my application.
