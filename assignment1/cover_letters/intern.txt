Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Intern position at Crane & Jenkins. As a recent graduate of Coral Springs University, I am eager to take on a part-time position. I am creative and tech-savvy, and I live for creating content that not only reaches a wide audience but sticks with them as well. I am efficient, can meet deadlines, and quickly create content. Using my social media and organizational skills, I am excited about the idea of assisting Crane & Jenkins, a place that helps young people live fulfilling lives.
I was recently the Social Media Manager at Retail Ocean, where I managed content calendars, wrote and edited posts, and moderated comments on social media channels. In addition, I served as the voice of the store, interacting with customers virtually. I scheduled when content was going to be posted, utilizing my organizational and critical thinking skills to publish shareable content. Through my efforts I kept customers happy and attracted new visitors.
I have experience with both pitching ideas and taking instruction, and I can seamlessly transition from writing for one platform to another. I am passionate about blending visual elements with text and can incorporate both into posts. With a goal to increase Retail Oceanâ€™s engagement on social media, I created a new social media strategy. It increased Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook activity by 70% in a month.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you, in addition to learning more about the Intern position and working for Crane & Jenkins. Varied experiences are essential to my growth, and interning at Crane & Jenkins will give me opportunities to apply my skills, help the team spread its message, and grow as a young professional.
