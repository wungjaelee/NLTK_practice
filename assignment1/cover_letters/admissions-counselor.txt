Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Admissions Counselor position at River Tech. I am confident that my previous experience and strong educational foundation will prove me an exceptional candidate for this position.
My previous role as an Admissions Counselor at Coral Springs University proved to be rewarding and educational for me. As an Admissions Counselor, I was responsible for providing prospective students with information and guidance about their program of interest, both in person and over the phone. I also helped enroll students throughout their college careers by answering questions, serving as a point of contact and helping them through tough times. I was also responsible for contacting inquiries that came in through various sources and making a concerted effort to reach each student on a personal level. It was most rewarding to see my students graduate after four long years, knowing that I did my best to help them complete their degree.
My work experience is complemented by my education from Hawaii Western University. There, I studied education with a minor in psychology. I enjoyed every minute of it. Because of my love for education, I decided to get my masterâ€™s degree in education as well. During my college experience, I often asked my Admissions Counselor about the details of her job. She was very passionate about her work, and she became a mentor to me. I knew that I wanted to become an Admissions Counselor too.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and the Admissions Counselor role.
