Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Personal Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins. As a high-energy and organized individual, I am confident in my ability to perform in the role of Personal Assistant. After high school, I decided to attend college at Coral Springs University. I originally started out as a Drama major but then switched to Business Administration after getting a part-time job as a Personal Assistant at a flower company. I loved the fast-paced environment and found it exciting to schedule deliveries.
In my previous role as a Personal Assistant at Cloud Clearwater, I was directly assigned to an Executive. My responsibilities included note-taking, scheduling, booking hotels and flights, renting conference rooms, ordering catering for luncheons, sending executive correspondences, and taking phone calls. I also did small projects and ran errands for my Executive.
As a Personal Assistant, I strive to provide accurate work, good communication, and error-free service. I know how valuable a Personal Assistant can be to an Executive who has bigger fish to fry than scheduling a meeting or picking up lunch. The most enjoyable part about being a Personal Assistant is the scheduling. While it can be mind-boggling at times, I have always found scheduling to be rather fun.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the Personal Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins and meeting in person to discuss the skills I can bring to your team. I believe I can exceed expectations in this role and am prepared to hit the ground running to help your organization succeed. Please feel free to call or email me.
