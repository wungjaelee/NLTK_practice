Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Human Resources Manager position at Crane & Jenkins. As a certified human resources professional, I gain satisfaction from serving my community by helping service-oriented companies like Crane & Jenkins acquire and retain talented employees. I look forward to assisting Crane & Jenkins in the improvement of employee relations by developing and implementing initiatives that support the employees from the moment of hire until the time of retirement.
As the Director of Human Resources at Wes Morgan Philips, I was a key senior leader in the organization and was responsible for improving the efficiency and performance of the company’s 540 employees. Before that, I worked in human resources, equal employment opportunity and diversity for Jenkins Technology Solutions, Inc. At Jenkins Technology Solutions Inc., I developed an employee retention plan that involved the creation of a wellness program, an internal training program and a promotions selection process, which led to a 50% reduction in the overall employee turnover rate.
Ten years of experience in human resources management and organizational development has provided me with the experience, skills and ability required to lead the human resource management team and help recruit and retain talented staff to make Crane & Jenkins one of the best places to work. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Human Resources and Labor Relations from Coral Springs University and a Master’s degree in Organizational Development and Strategic Human Resources from Northwest Vermont University.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience for the position of Human Resources Manager.
