To Whom It May Concern,

I saw the job posting for the position of Program Coordinator at your facility and would love to be considered for it. I believe my strengths, passion, and experience line up perfectly with this opportunity, and I know I would become a vital part of the Coral Springs University team.
Working at CSU would not be my first taste of program and event management in a collegiate atmosphere. During my time as a hospitality and tourism management undergrad at Hawaii Western, I interned with the facilities department. There, I received a crash course in setting up and preparing for large events. We also interacted with prospective and current clients and followed up with them after each event.
After graduation, I moved into the nonprofit world. I worked as a Recreation Coordinator for the Parks and Recreation Department in Turtle Bay, Hawaii. While our events were normally on a smaller scale than they were at Hawaii Western, the steps we needed to take were similar. Coordinating an event of any size includes specific, necessary steps to make the client happy and guarantee the event proceeds as planned.
Between my time helping with the facilities and events department to working as a Recreation Coordinator, I believe I have followed just the right stepping stones to becoming the Program Coordinator at Coral Springs University. I am familiar with an academic atmosphere and I love the enthusiasm that exists in such an environment. CSU sounds like a place that employs passionate and hardworking folks, which is just the kind of group Iâ€™d like to join as Program Coordinator.
