Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m very interested in the advertised Accounting Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. As someone who is detail-focused and has a flair for finances, I thrive on delivering innovative solutions that reduce costs and increase revenue. With more than eight years of experience as an accounting professional, I’m excited about the contributions I can make as a member of Cloud Clearwater’s expert team.
As an Accounting Manager at River Tech for the past four years, I was responsible for the monitoring of fiscal compliance for all company departments. I also lead internal contract and expense audits, and I managed department rebuttals to noncompliance reports. I was also responsible for organizing extensive quarterly financial reports into concise overviews and presenting my findings to the executive team. My strategic recommendations were praised by the CFO as “a vital component of the company’s fiscal health.”
I am well-versed in a variety of enterprise-level software systems, including Quickbooks, NetSuite ERP, and Microsoft Dynamics. In an effort to improve internal communications, I pioneered the use of custom reporting features that improved cross-functional collaboration and reduced spending waste by more than 25%. These reports were also instrumental in successfully navigating an IRS audit in 2015.
I appreciate your time and consideration. I’m eager to learn more about the Accounting Manager position and Cloud Clearwater. With my experience leading enterprise-level accounting operations, I am confident that I will be able to provide innovative budgeting and forecasting solutions to meet Cloud Clearwater’s fiscal objectives.
