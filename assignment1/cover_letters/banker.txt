Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Banker position at Crane & Jenkins. As an organized and professional lover of mathematics, I am confident that I can succeed as a Banker. While I am calculated and technical, I am also friendly and have the communication skills vital to the job of a Banker. I believe that my experience and education prove me well-qualified for the Banker position.
At Northwest Vermont University, I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Finance. I studied statistics, accounting, economics, portfolio management, business, and many other important topics. I am well-versed in finance, banking, and accounting. I interned at a bank for my capstone and learned a lot about the banking processes and procedures. During my childhood schooling, I excelled in my math courses. In high school, I was in the math club and took every advanced math course that my school had to offer.
During my previous role as Banker at River Tech, I was responsible for providing account services such as depositing checks, taking check orders, keeping detailed records of transactions, and opening and closing accounts. I prioritized paying attention to detail, providing excellent customer service, and staying up to date on all bank policies and procedures.
Thank you for taking this time to review me as a candidate for the Banker position at Crane & Jenkins. I look forward to learning more about the company and the expectations of the Banker position.
