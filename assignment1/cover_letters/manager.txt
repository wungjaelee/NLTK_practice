Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Manager position at Retail Ocean. With my extensive work experience and formidable education as the foundation for my skills and abilities, I believe I can be a valuable team player at Retail Ocean, the latest name in streetwear.
At my previous position as Manager of Cloud Clearwater, I effectively managed 30 employees. All of them directly reported to me. I was responsible for overseeing the opening and closing of the store, ensuring that payroll was processed on time, auditing time sheets, and handling employee and customer concerns professionally. My biggest priority was ensuring that the store ran smoothly and that all issues were addressed in a timely manner.
My ability to perform rests on the foundation of my education from Coral Springs University. As a graduate from the Business Administration program, I understand what it take to manage employees. I am well-versed in many aspects of business, including the financial portion. However, my education and work experience are tied together by my ability to empathize and communicate with others. I like to make people smile. It brings me great pleasure when an employee is truly succeeding and I get to promote them. It is also very rewarding to please my customers.
Thank you for your consideration for me as the Manager of Retail Ocean. I look forward to learning more about the company and its customers. I am positive that my education, care for others, and work experience will allow me to succeed as Manager.
