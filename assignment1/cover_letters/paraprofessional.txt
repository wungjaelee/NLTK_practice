Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to you in regards to the Paraprofessional job opening at River Tech School. As someone with a lifelong passion for learning, I have always thrived in a classroom setting. I thoroughly enjoy sharing my love of learning with my students, which has allowed me to gain valuable skills including patience and a strong work ethic. I am excited about the possibility of sharing my talents with your students and staff.
In my previous position at Crane & Jenkins Elementary School, I aided teachers in classrooms with upward of 20 students. In my 10 years there, I worked directly with the students, helping with their assignments and assisting them with reading. I collaborated with teachers and other colleagues to create after-school enrichment programs for the students. I was also responsible for assisting the teachers with clerical duties, such as grading and preparing classroom materials, and I filled in for teachers as needed.
Not only am I flexible and adaptable, but I also have a very strong work ethic. I pride myself on my punctuality, and I always fulfill any duties asked of me to the best of my ability. Iâ€™m also a team player who enjoys working alongside other colleagues. In collaboration with several of my colleagues, I helped create an after-school theater program for special needs students; it ran for seven years.
I am very dedicated to my work and I truly love my job. I would enjoy the opportunity to utilize my skills and creativity at River Tech. Thank you for your time and for considering me for the Paraprofessional position. I look forward to talking with you to learn more about this position.
