Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited about the possibility of working as a Dental Hygienist at Crane & Jenkins. As a person who is detail-oriented and intuitive, I excel in meeting the needs of my dental patients, finishing appointments ahead of schedule, and applying improved methods to ensure the best results during cleanings. I would love the opportunity to offer my talents to Crane & Jenkins, a leading dental provider in the area.
During my previous employment at River Tech, I acted as the Dental Hygienist for two dentists, educated patients regarding their oral health, and helped select software to streamline the appointment booking process. When a new system was implemented to book appointments, I went above and beyond by obtaining the manufacturer’s certification, which allowed me to train dental assistants and other hygienists on the system. The new system increased the number of appointments by 40%.
I am attentive to the needs of my patients and strive to create a relaxing environment and to ensure their comfort during cleanings. As a consummate professional, I enjoy challenging cases. For instance, many of my patients at River Tech had advanced gingivitis, so I became extremely vigilant to any signs of pain or distress. To ensure a high level of cleanliness, I also meticulously cleaned my instruments and the equipment and fixtures in the treatment rooms.
Thank you for your time and attention. I can’t wait to hear more details about the Dental Hygienist position at Crane & Jenkins. Growth is vital to my success as a Dental Hygienist, and I am committed to applying my skills and experience to support the dentists and future patients.
