Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Physical Therapist position at Cloud Clearwater. I am passionate about combining my knowledge of physiology with my clinical and interpersonal skills to create successful therapy plans and improve the overall patient experience.
During my previous role at River Tech, I had the opportunity to work with a wide range of patients, including pediatric, adolescent, and special needs patients. I owned the development and implementation of effective pain management and mobility improvement plans for more than 150 patients. I was also responsible for developing and overseeing the company’s first in-home care program, which now produces almost 50% of River Tech’s revenue.
In addition to my experience in delivering quality patient care, I have also taken on additional roles as a trainer and educator for new physical therapists. I developed a new hire training curriculum that reduced the onboarding period from 14 days to 9 days, and I spearheaded an innovative continuing education program that improved employee retention rates by 67%. This love of teaching also led me to create a personal blog showcasing proven techniques for improving bedside manner and enhancing patient relationships. The blog currently has more than 1,000 subscribers, ranging from first-year medical students to seasoned physical therapists.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Physical Therapist position and about Cloud Clearwater. My passion for helping people aligns well with Cloud Clearwater’s mission to provide comprehensive, compassionate care, and I’m eager for the opportunity to discuss how my extensive experience can best be used to produce successful patient outcomes.
