Dear Hiring Manager,

During my 30 years of experience as a Receptionist, Office Assistant, and Administrative Assistant, I have consistently met the needs of my team members and clients of the company. My recent position as Receptionist at Cloud Clearwater included operating a multi-line phone system, invoicing, event planning, scheduling, and performing all of the vital computer functions needed to succeed in the technological age. I have made it a priority to stay up to date on the latest technology so that I can properly serve those I am working with.
Because of my vast knowledge of office functions and my years of experience, I feel that I can add great value to River Tech. By being knowledgeable of the latest trends in office supplies and technology, I am confident that I can serve the company and its clients well.
