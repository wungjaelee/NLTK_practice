Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Teaching Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater. I have a passion for sharing knowledge and inspiring students, and I am thrilled at the opportunity to make a positive impact on the community at Cloud Clearwater.
While working at River Tech Academy as a Teaching Assistant, I was responsible for helping with lesson plans, monitoring students, maintaining student records, and assisting students with study skills and special assignments. I worked primarily with students in grades 6-8 and served as a substitute teacher for grade 6 classrooms on more than a dozen occasions. I was recognized by my principal for my ability to develop student-centric teaching plans based on each class’s individual interests and needs and, as a result, was given the role of “Graduation Liaison” to help prepare outgoing students for their transition to high school.
As someone with more than four years of experience as a teaching assistant, I understand the importance of creating a challenging, fun, and safe environment for students. I take pride in getting to know students on a personal level to better understand their needs, and I enjoy taking an active role in coordinating extracurricular activities. During my time at River Tech Academy, I founded a well-attended book club and a math tutoring group that raised students’ test scores by an average of 20%.
Thank you for your consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Teaching Assistant position and about Cloud Clearwater. I am committed to enhancing my skills as an educator, and I’m excited about the opportunity to learn and grow with Cloud Clearwater’s talented team.
