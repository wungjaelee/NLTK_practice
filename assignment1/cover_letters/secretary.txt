Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Secretary position at Crane & Jenkins, the leading name in equipment rentals. With my education and work experience, I am confident in my ability to deliver as the Secretary at Crane & Jenkins.
At my previous role at TradeLot, I provided secretarial and administrative services for an equipment rental company. I effectively performed tasks such as invoicing, client intake, paperwork, filing, managing all incoming calls, scheduling events, setting up catering and rooms for company events, and ordering supplies. I am well-versed in equipment rental jargon, and I have an in-depth understanding of the business.
My education from Coral Springs University was in construction management. I also have a minor in business administration. I have wanted to study construction ever since I was a child as my father built and rented out houses. I was always fascinated by the tractors, backhoes, and excavators that my father used in his work. I helped my father a lot as a child; he even taught me invoicing at the age of 10. I performed many administrative functions for my father until he closed his business when I was 17, and those skills have proved to be invaluable.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane & Jenkins and its clients. I am confident in my ability to perform as Secretary because of my longstanding history with administrative work in the construction field and my education.
