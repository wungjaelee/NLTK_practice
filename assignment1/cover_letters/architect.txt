Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Architect position at Cloud Clearwater. With a background in project management and a passion for design, I deliver a unique combination of artistic talent and technical expertise. I’m thrilled at the opportunity to bring more than 10 years of experience as an Architect to Cloud Clearwater’s industry-leading team.
During my previous role at River Tech, I was responsible for preparing a full complement of construction documents for high- and mid-rise commercial, residential, and mixed-use properties. I have specialized training in sustainability techniques and extensive real-world experience in identifying project risks and advising client stakeholders on mitigation strategies. This expertise allowed me to save River Tech clients more than $15 million in unnecessary costs in 2017 alone.
In addition to my expertise in design, I’m also proficient with the major CAD software systems, including AutoCAD, Revit, ArchiCAD and SketchUp. In 2013, I spearheaded an initiative to use these systems to integrate 360-degree panoramic renderings into our client presentations, which resulted in a 150% growth in sales. These renderings have also resulted in improved client communication during project construction and have been praised by clients for providing “incomparable clarity and direction” during all stages of development.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Architect position and about Cloud Clearwater. I’m eager to combine my artistic talents with my technical skills to create award-winning designs for Cloud Clearwater’s portfolio of clients.
