Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m happy to have the opportunity to apply for the Psychologist position at Crane & Jenkins, and I’m eager to learn more about this job posting. Working in the psychology field has been my lifelong calling, and I believe that I would make a valuable addition to your team.
At my previous position at Cloud Clearwater Medical Center, I worked as a Psychologist for eight years and helped a wide variety of patients improve their lives by teaching them effective coping techniques and helping them to change their behavioral patterns. Follow-up studies showed that 87% of these patients noticed a significant improvement in their mental health and overall well-being. I have always enjoyed interacting with each patient and learning how I can help them face daily challenges.
My passion for working in the Psychology field inspired me to attend Northwest Vermont University, where I graduated with my Master’s and Doctorate Degree in the field of Psychology. I participated in multiple studies on depression. One of the experiments focused on alleviating the signs of depression and improving a patient’s overall well-being. This study provided valuable information to researchers, and 73% of participants felt an improvement in their symptoms. Overall, this study was vital in helping doctors create additional guidelines for patients that suffer from this disorder.
Thank you for considering my application and reading my cover letter for the Psychologist position at Crane & Jenkins. I believe that my past job experience and education has prepared me for this job, and I’m looking forward to finding out more. If you need to contact me, I’m always available, and I hope to continue to the next stage in the hiring process.
