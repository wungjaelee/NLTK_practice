To Whom It May Concern,

I have two passions in life. The first is creating and nurturing art. The second is working with children to help them create as well. I cannot help but think the opportunity to become an Art Teacher at River Tech is the perfect place for me. My love of art started at a very young age. I was constantly drawing, painting, sewing, and frankly, ruining. Not all art generated by a child is going to be beneficial! But from staining a few too many surfaces at my parents’ house, I grew passionate about my skills.
I took the next step by attending Longford Tech. Teaching wasn’t immediately on my radar, but it soon followed. I honed my craft while simultaneously expanding my horizons. A love of art grew into a love of helping others with their art, and eventually, teaching others.
After graduation, I worked at Retail Ocean, a studio in town. Not all students were children, which actually worked to my benefit. I learned the different patterns necessary to teach students of all ages and skill levels. And just because someone is older does not mean they are more advanced in a specific technique or craft. The balance aided me greatly as I moved to working exclusively with children.
Even children have vastly different learning curves. And finding each student’s learning technique is part of the fun. Seeing a young child create a piece of art after hardly knowing the first step to doing so is a joy that cannot be matched. Becoming an Art Teacher at River Tech would stoke this joy, and I would love to be considered for the position.
