I enjoy building a relationship with each client and ensuring that they receive the ultimate customer support. I graduated from Northwest Vermont University with a four-year degree in computer science. I am also certified as a computer support specialist and undergo additional training twice a year to ensure that I remain up to date with the latest technical services.
