Dear Hiring Manager,

Marketing 101 at Coral Springs University sparked an infinite interest in marketing in a young, impressionable freshman sitting front row center, and now, as a college graduate, I am thrilled to apply for the Marketing Intern position with Crane & Jenkins. I am passionate about the new meaning of marketing, making things mission-based instead of sales-based, and I would love to channel my skills as the Marketing Intern.
While at Coral Springs, I worked as one of the interns for Housing and Residence Life at the university and learned the practical applications of marketing. We, as marketing interns under supervision, were in charge of handling the departmentâ€™s social media accounts and creating social media graphics, but we also observed as the Marketing Director created and distributed print marketing materials.
I am confident, self-motivated, and I love creating and promoting brands. During my time with the Housing Department, I learned to emphasize and treasure their brand and mission, and I would love to transfer that knowledge and passion to the Crane & Jenkins brand. I am a creative thinker, but I work well in a team and love having the ability to bounce ideas off of other creative, like-minded thinkers. Nonetheless, I am able to quickly swap between creative and practical tasks. I am extremely organized and skilled at keeping spreadsheets and databases, so my talents extend past the typical marketing skills to business skills as well.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon to set up an interview. I can be contacted at either cfredrickson@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
