Dear Hiring Manager,

I capture moments. My photography philosophy is to skip the posed, staged shots and get to the heart of the matter: love. From engagements to graduations to family photos, I work with love. In fact, I think that every truly beautiful moment deserves a photo to back it up. That’s why I do what I do, and I would love to join the Cloud Clearwater team. With my vision and your resources, I’m sure we could make memories that will last lifetimes.
While studying photography at Hawaii Western, I began a small photography business to cater to those special moments we all have at university. I covered a few tropical weddings, capturing the essence of that magical time when man and woman become one, and I stood vigil as babies were brought into the church. Each of these affairs was intimate and full of emotion, and I was proud to be a part of their big moments, but I am ready to lend my talents to a larger firm.
I created a portfolio of the most creative and special moments I caught on camera and have achieved them both at @HaddingtonPhotography and on www.HaddingtonPhotography.com. In addition to my favorite pictures, I asked each of my clients to pick their favorite photo to be featured on social media or the website and why they loved it so much. This, I believe, helped market Haddington Photography to where it is today, and I would love to apply this strategy to a new position with Cloud Clearwater.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. I can be reached at either ihaddington@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
