Dear Hiring Manager,

I wish to convey my interest in the open position for a Librarian at Cloud Clearwater Library. I believe that my well-rounded skill set, experience, and enthusiasm for the job make me a strong candidate. Cloud Clearwater Library is a thriving hub in this community, and I would greatly enjoy being a part of the team that helps this library grow and meet the information needs of its patrons.
Previously, I worked at Coral Springs Public Library. I was responsible for acquisitions, scheduling, implementing library policy, and training new staff members. I also actively participated in programming for both adults and children, as well as attended conferences and workshops to keep current with policies and upcoming trends. In my time here, the children’s programming attendance increased by 50%, adult programming attendance by almost 100%, and overall visits by 20%.
Working with the public, I’ve come to understand the importance of strong customer service skills, and I believe that every patron should receive a warm, personalized level of communication. I have worked with diverse communities and am well-versed in evaluating their needs. My goal is to treat every patron equally and to ensure open access to all by upholding the library’s values.
I am enthusiastic about presenting myself as a representative in the community and networking to better serve the library system. I am eager to speak more with you about this opportunity, and I hope you will consider me for the Librarian position. I believe my initiative, customer service skills, and dedication to library values would make me an asset to your team, and I look forward to hearing from you.
