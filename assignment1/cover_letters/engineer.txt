Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for the Engineer position at TradeLot. This specific role perfectly captures what I hoped to achieve as an engineer when starting my career journey. The work your company does is fascinating, and I have read in great detail about the cutting-edge technology being utilized. This position would help set me on the right path to achieve my career goals.
During my previous role at River Tech, I learned to work in interdisciplinary teams that included both technical and non-technical disciplines. Here, I was able to flourish as an effective communicator that was able to ensure that all stakeholders’ needs were both communicated effectively to the team and met to the clients’ highest level of satisfaction.
I was able to implement a new testing procedure that cut our beta testing phase by up to 12%, meaning the clients were able to see a finished prototype weeks before our competitors. Also, I am currently studying for my Fundamentals of Engineering exam, which will set me on the path to become a Professional Engineer (PE). I hope to grow as both an employee of TradeLot and as a professional in this role. In this new role, I am willing to work diligently to meet the needs of the company and to become a productive part of the team as quickly as possible.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Engineer position and about TradeLot. My previous experience makes me an ideal candidate for this position, and I hope to be given an opportunity to show the team firsthand what an asset I can be. I look forward to hearing back from you.
