Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to apply for the Registered Nurse position within your company, Crane & Jenkins Medical Center. As a current student studying nursing at Coral Springs University, gaining this job experience is necessary for my growth in this field of study. I believe I would be a great addition to your team of nurses because I have experience working at hospitals and have completed all of my course requirements with higher-than-average grades.
I previously worked at River Tech Memorial where I applied my skills of proper nursing in the work environment. Furthermore, I volunteered for nearby companies, such as Red Cross, who were in need of assistance in administering treatment and answering patientsâ€™ needs.
Accomplishments I have earned include volunteer awards for hours of community service, best customer service, and awards for implementing my real-world nursing techniques at my previous job. These achievements have made me into not only a better employee but a better person as a whole. I have experienced many events that have positively influenced my attitude, work ethic, and confidence as a nurse.
Personally, I am more than excited to apply for this role as a Registered Nurse for your company. I believe that there is room for growth, communication, and improvement that will help me thrive in this environment. I would greatly appreciate your consideration of my application and hope to hear from you regarding an interview.
