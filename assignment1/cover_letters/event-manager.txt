Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Event Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. As a high-energy, experienced professional with an eye for detail, I firmly believe that I can provide Cloud Clearwater with outstanding event management services.
My previous role as Event Manager at Crane & Jenkins included responsibilities like managing the event staff, coordinating the details of weddings, conferences, birthday parties, and charity events, hiring and training new staff, making budgets, booking venues, setting up decorations, and organizing catering. All of these responsibilities gave me valuable experience in all of the areas of event planning. I was determined to become an expert in each aspect of the job. It was very rewarding to see everything come together on the day of the event and the clients having a great time at their party.
I first became interested in event planning when my mother decided to remarry. All of her friends tried to talk her out of having a wedding at all, but I encouraged her to plan a special ceremony. Since no one else wanted to help her plan the wedding, I took up the role as her personal wedding planner. I was only 21, but in just a few short months, I planned an entire wedding for my mother and executed it beautifully.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I anticipate learning more about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I am confident that my experience and love for event planning will prove me to be an excellent fit for the Event Manager position at Cloud Clearwater.
