Dear Hiring Manager,

I have a passion for connecting with people and creating drinks that people will order many times over. Moreover, I’d like the opportunity to bring my experience and creativity to Cloud Clearwater as a Bartender for your evening shift. I’ve been a Bartender for 15 years, working at restaurants, golf clubs, and martini lounges. And the clientele of Cloud Clearwater is similar to that of several of the places where I have served previously.
Most recently, I worked as the shift lead at my previous establishment, a martini lounge that attracts many professionals and paraprofessionals for business meetings and after-work cocktails. In that role, I trained incoming Bartenders on our specialty drinks and our standards for customer service and mixing. I also revised our procedures for ensuring food safety and implemented an internal food safety audit. Additionally, I also created a signature drink that is a spin-off a salted caramel martini and plays well with the current general culinary trend of salt with chocolate or caramel.
I often receive compliments from the owners that I am very capable of engaging with people, both the staff and customers. I am also complimented on my ability to correct newer Bartenders in a way that is encouraging but also serves the guest in a timely fashion.
I would love the opportunity to talk to you in person, meet your current staff, and learn more about your establishment. Thank you for your time and consideration of my employment at Cloud Clearwater.
