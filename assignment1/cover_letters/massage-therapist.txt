Dear Hiring Manager,

I was pleased to see your opening for the Massage Therapist position at Cloud Clearwater Massage. People choose to seek massage therapy for a wide variety of reasons, and as someone who has been practicing for 10 years as a Massage Therapist, I am highly aware of them all, including sports injury, mastectomy, and stress.
I hold current certifications in many techniques, such as deep tissue massage, aromatherapy and reflexology. Along with my current certifications, I am able to match clientsâ€™ needs with the techniques that will be most effective in treating their condition and managing their symptoms.
I am not only adept at understanding what techniques will bring a person relief, but I am also knowledgeable about how the different parts of the body work in tandem with each other. Moreover, clients sometimes need a combination of services, and I am skilled at recognizing when the client would benefit from another form of therapy. I have helped clients find the right combination of services for their particular conditions by reaching out to my network of fellow practitioners in other fields, such as physical therapy and chiropractic therapy.
I want to thank you for your time and consideration of me for the Massage Therapist position at Cloud Clearwater Massage. Helping people to feel good and live with less pain and fatigue is my passion. I look forward to learning more about the position as well as the needs of your center and your current and prospective clients.
