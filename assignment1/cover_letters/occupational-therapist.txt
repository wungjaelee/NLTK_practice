Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to be applying for the Occupational Therapist position at Cloud Clearwater. Working in the occupational therapy field has been my ultimate career goal, and I am grateful for the opportunity. This job is highly rewarding, as being able to help patients improve their quality of life is an invaluable experience that cannot be found in the vast majority of jobs. I believe that my prior experience and unique skill set is perfect for this job opportunity.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I worked as an Occupational Therapist for seven years and helped patients improve their motor skills for day-to-day activities. During my time working at Crane & Jenkins, 94% of my patients significantly improved their ability to perform everyday activities. The health of a patient is my top priority, and I always look for new ways to improve the well-being of each patient.
I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Northwest Vermont University, and I was in the top 10 of my graduating class. Occupational Therapy has always been my passion, and I knew from an early age that I wanted to work in this career field. Each patient is different, and I love the challenge of helping each one improve and reach their fullest potential.
Thank you for taking the time to read my cover letter and resume. I hope to hear from you soon and learn additional details regarding the Occupational Therapist position. I believe that I will be a valuable addition to your team and can significantly improve the life of each patient. I look forward to the next stage in the hiring process.
