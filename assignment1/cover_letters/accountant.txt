Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Accounting Specialist position at Crane & Jenkins. When I read the job description, I was excited to apply since I have visited the facility and highly admire the care Crane & Jenkins provides to the chronically ill and disabled youth of the community. I believe the job duties listed align well with my skills. You need someone who is highly organized and effective and who can remain positive and pleasant under strict deadlines. I believe my experience and education serves me well for this role.
In my previous capacity as a Staff Accountant at River Tech, I accurately maintained multiple ledgers within Quickbooks while self-managing multiple projects and learning new concepts regularly under deadlines. I was responsible for compiling the company’s financial statements for the purposes of providing it to the auditor. I acted as the liaison between the external audit team and the internal accounting department.
I have also worked in several customer service roles over the years prior to receiving my post-secondary education, allowing me to develop excellent communication and conflict resolution skills. I am proficient in accounting software including, but not limited to, MS Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and various other tax and accounting software.
Having worked on many teams and as a people-oriented person, I am very enthusiastic about the possibility to work with a diverse team while managing sole responsibilities as an Accountant. I welcome the opportunity discuss how my qualifications would be an asset to Crane & Jenkins’ continued success. My resume is enclosed for your reference.
