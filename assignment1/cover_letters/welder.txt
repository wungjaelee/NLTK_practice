Dear Hiring Manager,

It is a pleasure to be applying for the Welder position at River Tech. As a lifelong Welder, I am excited to be a candidate at the number one welding company in the tri-county area.
During my tenure at Crane & Jenkins, my responsibilities included using a variety of welders, shapers, cutters, and measuring tools, repairing and maintaining metal equipment,and interpreting diagrams. Communication skills and exact execution of safety procedures were major parts of my job, also. During my 10 years at Crane and Jenkins, I became an expert welder, and earned several accolades, including the 2015 Welding Safety Expert Award.
Welding is in my blood. My father was a welder his whole life. From a very young age, I took interest in what he was doing out in the garage. Though my mother protested, my father bought me a child-size welding mask. I was fascinated by the beauty of the flames, it felt magical to see two separate parts become one. Each day after school I would run to the garage to join my father on his projects. Welding made me feel powerful. After high school, I studied welding at Longford Tech, and became certified.
I look forward to learning more about River Tech and the Welder position. My education, experience, and love for welding makes me confident that I will exceed the expectations of this position and become a valuable team member at River Tech.
