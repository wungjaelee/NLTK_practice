Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Counselor position at River Tech. As a caring professional with a background in psychology and five years of counseling experience, I believe that I am well-suited for this position.
During my tenure at Cloud Clearwater High School, I was a guidance counselor for approximately 300 freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. My duties included scheduling classes, resolving conflict between students, making class schedules for each student and setting up accommodations for students with special needs. I take pride in providing each student with compassion and care because some students don’t get that from home. I counseled many students who came from broken homes. Their parents were drug addicts or missing. Some students were abused. It was heartbreaking. I made sure to be a role model and mentor to students as well as a listening ear. I took student concerns very seriously.
My success as a counselor is rooted in my education from Coral Springs University. I earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology with a minor in secondary education. I have known I wanted to help people since I was a young girl. My family had several issues that my high school guidance counselor helped me resolve. I have always admired her and decided that the best way to help others was to follow in her footsteps.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about the Counselor position at River Tech.
