Dear Chief Pilot and Hiring Manager,

I read your posting for a Pilot position for the King Air 200 route between Denver, Colorado, and Dallas, Texas, with great interest. I earned a B.S. at Green Valley State, where I completed my baccalaureate with a major in meteorology and a minor in public relations. Last year, I completed my flight training at Longford Tech’s flight training program. I believe I’d be an excellent fit as a Pilot for Cloud Clearwater Aviation.
My current Pilot ratings are as follows: Private Pilot VFR/IFR, Commercial and Multi-Engine, and CFI II. It was through much hard work that I was brought on to work the flight line while at Longford Tech. During that time, I worked my way up and became rated as a certified flight instructor II in the institution’s King Air.
I understand all that is involved in flight training and certainly understand that your company must carefully analyze all the credentials of each applicant. Therefore, attached are references from my previous and current employers that vouch for my integrity and confirm my safety rating in all my flying endeavors. I have also attached copies of my Federal Aviation Administration Licenses and ratings. Please notice the attached copies of my logbooks and the impressive quantity of flight time that I have earned while on this rewarding career path.
Thank you for your consideration and time. Attached are my resume, letters of recommendation. I look forward to learning more about the position, and I hope to hear from you soon.
