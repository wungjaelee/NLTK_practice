Dear Hiring Manager,

I can’t remember a time when I wasn’t styling hair. My youngest memories are of me putting anything with hair into my “Styling Chair,” and while my skills have undoubtedly improved, my passion for the profession hasn’t changed. Today, I’m excited to apply for the Hair Stylist position at Retail Ocean Salon. I adore both the creative and the simple, and I would love to bring my talents to the team to further my career as a stylist.
Recently, I graduated from Green Valley State Beauty School, where I worked as a beautician in our school’s salon. I quickly gained traction as a favorite stylist, getting rave reviews for my skill not only with my comb but also with my people skills. With this position, I dabbled in everything from signature cuts to specialty color treatments, and I received the Most Satisfied Customers award from the salon and an award for Most Creative Cuts.
Throughout my time at Green Valley State Beauty School, I archived my best cuts into a modern portfolio via Instagram, and I gained over 2,000 followers, garnering even more customers. My Instagram became a way to connect with not only students and potential customers but also the world of beauty bloggers, which helped me gain traction in our digital world, so if I join the Retail Ocean team, I could easily transfer this platform and my following to the Retail Ocean family.
Thank you so much for your consideration for this position. Feel free to check out my portfolio on Instagram @sofiastyles, and I hope to hear from you soon to set up an interview. I can be contacted at either sflores@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
