Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m very excited to be applying for the position of Speech Language Pathologist at Cloud Clearwater Speech Therapy. As someone who has been working with children and adults with speech conditions for 10 years, I have diagnosed and provided therapy to patients with a wide variety of conditions. I have worked with people with all three major categories of speech disorders: fluency, articulation and voice.
In my previous role as Speech Language Pathologist at Crane & Jenkins Speech Therapy Center, I worked primarily with children who had fluency and articulation disorders. In that role, I helped hundreds of children learn to control the muscles in their lips and tongue as well as how to coordinate their voice and modulate their breath. I also helped children who stutter to develop techniques that controlled secondary symptoms of stuttering.
As a Speech Language Pathologist at Crane & Jenkins Speech Therapy Center, I was evaluated and assessed on my ability to gain each child’s trust, identify the cause of the disorder and develop a plan for therapy. These evaluations have allowed me to modify my approach and increase its effectiveness, leading to 92% of the children I treated developing significant improvements in their speech and communication skills. I would love the opportunity to share my experience with colleagues at Cloud Clearwater Speech Therapy.
I look forward to learning more about your center’s focus and meeting colleagues and clients to see if I would be a good fit for your center.
