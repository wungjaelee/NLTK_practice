Dear Hiring Manager,

Considering my background in the physical sciences, I’m extremely excited to be applying for the Scientist position at River Tech. As a highly analytical individual, I aim to always make rational and objective observations about the world around me. I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to offer my talents to River Tech, which is one of the top research organizations in the business world today.
While working in my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I evaluated professional research as part of an internal self-regulation policy designed to maintain high standards of quality and credibility in various fields of scientific inquiry. Always on a mission to ensure complete objectivity in all of our projects, I made sure that all research met certain exacting guidelines before it went into any of the company’s publications.
While at Cloud Clearwater, I was able to apply many of the skills I earned while majoring in Biomedical Studies at Longford Tech. Understanding that data-driven presentations are absolutely necessary when sharing complex scientific concepts, I proposed and carried out a plan to move our visuals to a new digital design platform that combines eye candy with hard facts that increased researcher participation by 40%.
I’m grateful for this opportunity. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Scientist position and the River Tech corporate family as a whole. I’m a committed individual looking to join a goal-oriented team, and I feel that River Tech offers me an environment where I can apply my skills on worthy projects.
