Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Production Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins Productions. As a Communications student at Coral Springs University, I am eager to take on a part-time or internship position. I work quickly and efficiently and am meticulously organized. I can craft and edit content while getting projects done on time. Putting my strengths to use, I am excited about the idea of helping Crane & Jenkins Productions, a company that produces first-rate entertainment.
I was recently the Development Intern at Cloud Clearwater Pictures. A goal of Cloud Clearwater Picturesâ€™ internship program is for students to get hands-on experience with the movie and television development process. While there, I researched pilots and films and helped decide which should go into production. I also managed desk duties, taking calls, responding to emails and setting up meetings. In addition, I helped talent and assisted with casting multiple features.
As a result of my role as Development Intern, I have gained experience reviewing and editing books and scripts. I am also skilled at writing press releases, articles and pitch summaries. Some of the announcements I wrote have since been used to publicize some of the most talked-about projects in the industry. My supervisor set a goal for me to make decisions on 50 films and pilots during my four-month stint. I made decisions on 100, surpassing that goal by 50.
Thank you for your consideration and time. Attached are my resume, letters of recommendation and a link to my portfolio, which features written and production work. Please let me know if you need any additional information. I look forward to learning more about the Production Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins Productions, and I hope to hear from you soon.
