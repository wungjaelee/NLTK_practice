Dear School Board,

Iâ€™m excited to apply for the position of Special Education Teacher at Cloud Clearwater. Your school notably has one of the best special education departments in the city, and I would love to be a part of it. I would love to learn more from the other teachers and bring my own ideas to the department to help make it even better.
I have been a Special Education Teacher at Crane & Jenkins for three years. During this time, I became skilled at working with parents and in the development of IEPs. I had about 20 students each day and saw much improvement in their skills throughout each year. I had two aides who worked with me. I was able to train them in such a way that they needed very little supervision. This allowed me more time to attend to paperwork and the development of curriculum.
Integration into regular classes was an important aspect of the program at Crane & Jenkins. During the course of my three years as the Special Education Teacher there, I was able to accomplish an integration of 25% in some children and up to 100% in others depending on the disabilities and needs of the child involved.
Thank you for the time and consideration you have put into my application. I feel that special education is a very important part of our schools. I would like very much to be a part of the special education department at Cloud Clearwater. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about this position.
