Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Accounts Payable position at River Tech. As an experienced and professional Accounts Payable clerk, I am excited to be applying at River Tech, a champion in workforce staffing. Based on my previous experience and education, I feel confident in my ability to execute the Accounts Payable position.
Throughout my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for reconciliation, charging expenses to the cost center, ensuring timely payment of vendors, paying employees by verifying expense reports, maintaining ledgers, keeping records, and upholding confidentiality. By nature, I am a meticulous, data-oriented person. I have always been a very detail-oriented and organized person.
My academic career started at Longford Tech, where I received a bachelor’s degree in finance. At Longford Tech, I took subjects such as economics, business, bonds, corporate finance, financial reporting, statistics, portfolio management, and government finance. Upon the completion of my bachelor’s degree, I decided to pursue a master’s degree at Coral Springs University in accounting. My education has made me more organized, more analytical, and more detailed. I have developed pristine time management and decision-making skills.
Thank you for your time and consideration of me as a candidate for the Accounts Payable position at River Tech. I look forward to learning more about the company, its clients, and the position.
