To Whom It May Concern,

A young Chef always dreams of creating their own menu. When I became aware of the opening at Cloud Clearwater, I knew it was the right opportunity for me to pursue. It would be a dream come true to even be seriously considered for this position of Chef. It would mean all my hard work was paying off.
I spent some time early in my life at Longford Tech. Though I didn’t complete my full degree, it was five semesters well spent. My time at school helped me learn and focus on what I really wanted to do with my life: cook. Throughout school, besides attending business classes, I grew my hobby into my passion.
Instead of staying for my full degree at Longford Tech, I moved to a great opportunity when the time was right. The chance to work and create in a kitchen at a real restaurant was too intriguing to pass up. Though I wasn’t creating the menu by any means, my position at TradeLot allowed me to do the next best thing. It prepared me for the work and desire it takes to create and run a menu, and I learned that the best dishes often come from tweaks to original plans.
If given the opportunity to create my own menu at Cloud Clearwater, I know I will not waste it. This is the chance I have been waiting for since leaving school early and seeking out my passion of cooking. Even before getting started, I know every test meal will not be a hit. However, I can promise that every piece of food that makes it to the customers will be my best effort.
