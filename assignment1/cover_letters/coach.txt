To Whom It May Concern,

As I strive to become the best Coach I can be, I am currently scouting for positions that would allow me to do so. After seeing the opening for Coach at Green Valley State, I know this is a perfect fit for me and would love the opportunity to prove myself.
My coaching career began as a graduate assistant in school. I worked while attending Coral Springs University. While it was occasionally tricky to balance school with my duties as an Assistant Coach, the work was entirely worth it. I wouldn’t be where I am today without that start.
After graduating, I stayed on at CSU to continue helping the staff. My position was upgraded, as were my responsibilities. This was the jump I was looking for. Helping the students with their own school and sports balance was a dream. It wasn’t always easy, but that made it feel even better when results were witnessed.
My first big break came in the form of a full-time Assistant Coaching position at Hawaii Western. As an assistant, I was tasked with forming my own game plans, making in-game adjustments, and constantly teaching the kids what was necessary to find success. It isn’t everyone who is as fortunate as me to be able to do what they love as a career. While that has remained true, my wish is to lead Green Valley State as Head Coach. This is a grand opportunity that fits into exactly what I have worked toward. You have a tremendous group of kids here, and I want to be a part of their growth into young men.
