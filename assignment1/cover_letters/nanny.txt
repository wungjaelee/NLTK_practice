Dear Hiring Manager,

Thank you for considering me as a candidate for the Nanny position at Crane & Jenkins. My experience with children paired with my education in Early Childhood Development makes me confident that Crane & Jenkins is a place where I can add value. It would give me great pleasure to become a part of your team.
As the oldest of five children, I played a major role in the upbringing of my two brothers and two sisters. My father was a hardworking man, but the role of child-raising was placed on my mother. As I got older, I began to take on more and more of the responsibilities associated with raising my siblings and running the house. As much of my time as it took up, I loved it. I knew I had developed a passion for caring for babies and young children. Their well-being was my biggest concern.
As my siblings became more self-sufficient, I began a babysitting service for my neighbors. During my four years of high school, I babysat three to four nights a week, and overall, I cared for about 50 babies and small children. I knew I had already found my dream job, but I wanted to make a living wage. I decided to attend Coral Springs University. I earned my degree in Early Childhood Development and continued babysitting throughout college.
Thank you for your consideration and time. I believe that my education and background with children will prove me an excellent candidate for the Nanny position at Crane & Jenkins. I hope to learn more about the company and become a valuable team member by bringing all my existing skills to the table, along with a willingness to grow and continue learning.
