While I was working in the science department, 94% of the students passed their end of school exams, which was an improvement from 83% in the previous years.
Before I worked at Northwest Vermont University, I went to college at Coral Springs University and earned an Associate’s Degree in the education field. My overall GPA was a 3.8, and I finished in the top 5% of my graduating class. I am well-qualified to work as a teacher’s aide, and I believe that I can make a positive impact on the students at Green Valley State.
Thank you for reviewing my cover letter and resume. I look forward to learning more information about the Teacher’s Aide position.
