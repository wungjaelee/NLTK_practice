Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to inquire about the Veterinary Assistant position at TradeLot. With a biology M.A. from Hawaii Western and nearly a decade of real-world hospital experience, I believe that I would bring tremendous value to the table.
My wide breadth of knowledge includes extensive study of both the animal kingdom and the human body. In fact, while studying biology at Hawaii Western, I minored in zoology. Upon graduation, I worked as an intern at Cloud Clearwater Hospital. There, learning health and wellness techniques while treating basic injuries and illnesses was of vital importance. I learned how to organize patient lists, communicate with patients and families in a compassionate and productive manner, and supervise medical students.
After a year of moving up from the ranks of intern, I was offered a Veterinary Assistant job with Crane & Jenkins. There, I was able to apply my skills in a setting that exposed me directly to animals. I learned important skills like how to work with frightened animals and how to administer appropriate dosages of vaccine medications. My experiences have allowed me to work with dogs, cats, birds, rodents, and even horses.
Though I love my job at Crane & Jenkins, Iâ€™m eager to expand my skills and bring value to a larger and more challenging veterinary environment. I would be pleased to present references from my current and former employers, and I look forward to learning more about this exciting position.
