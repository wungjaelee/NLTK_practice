Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Medical Receptionist position at River Tech. As a highly detailed and quality-driven administrative professional with more than nine years of medical front office experience, I thrive on delivering remarkable patient care in a fast-paced clinical setting. I’m eager for the opportunity to bring my relationship-focused approach to the pediatric patient community at River Tech.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for a wide variety of tasks including answering phones, managing patient scheduling, greeting patients, verifying patient forms, and handling electronic medical records in full compliance with HIPAA guidelines. With my extensive experience in handling insurance claims, I am well-versed in the verification process and am deeply familiar with ICD 10, CPT, and HCPC codes. I was also responsible for managing accounts receivable records and collecting payments, and successfully reduced outstanding account balances by 20%.
It’s clear that you’re looking for someone who thrives in a fast-paced clinical environment, and is capable of anticipating needs and exceeding expectations of both physicians and patients. I am adept at balancing multiple tasks while demonstrating top-level organization, problem solving, and communication skills. I was praised by my manager for my ability to consistently provide outstanding patient service, and consistently received five-star ratings and positive feedback on patient satisfaction surveys.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Medical Receptionist position and about River Tech. I believe my extensive technical skills and commitment to fostering patient relationships will allow me to provide exceptional service to River Tech’s staff and patients and support the practice’s continued success.
