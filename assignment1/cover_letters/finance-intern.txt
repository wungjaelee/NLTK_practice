Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Finance Intern position at River Tech. As a finance student at Coral Springs University, I am excited to be applying for this position. Over the past three and a half years, I have become knowledgeable and well-versed in the field, and I feel confident in my ability to deliver in this position.
During my academic career, I studied a variety of courses that have given me the knowledge I know I need to be successful in the finance field. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to learn about macroeconomics, microeconomics, personal finance, project management, business, accounting, and human resources management. I am an individual who pays very close attention to detail. I have the ability to solve complex financial issues, and I possess strong analytical skills. My oral and written communication skills are stellar. I perform well in fast-paced environments.
Throughout my life I have been a natural mathematician. In high school, I took advanced math courses, college math courses, and went to a math camp each summer. During my junior and senior years, I was president of the math club and won the state championship. In college, I was a student tutor for the math department under the work-study program.
Thank you for your time and consideration of me as a candidate for the Finance Intern role at River Tech. I look forward to learning more about the company.
