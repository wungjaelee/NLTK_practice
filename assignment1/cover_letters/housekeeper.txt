Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Housekeeper position at Cloud Clearwater. As a meticulous person with an eye for detail, I am confident that my abilities can be of great value at Cloud Clearwater. I am committed to providing excellent housekeeping service each time I enter a home.
In my previous role as Housekeeper at Crane & Jenkins, I worked five days a week, carefully and efficiently cleaning an average of four homes per day. I did not leave the home until the job was properly finished. I take great pride in my work and I want everything to be spotless when I leave someone’s home. I have cleaned homes of many sizes. No matter how large or small the home is, I always ensure that everything is completed in a timely manner.
As an experienced housekeeper, I am familiar with the products and tools needed to perform the job effectively. I know how to properly apply cleaning products, deploy efficient cleaning techniques, and use a variety of equipment. I don’t mind being hands-on in my work, and I am not afraid to get dirty. It brings me great pleasure to provide homeowners with a fresh, clean home.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to learning more about Cloud Clearwater, its clients, and its expectations. As a seasoned Housekeeper who takes pride in my work, I look forward to providing excellent cleaning services to the clients at Cloud Clearwater.
