To Whom It May Concern,

I am inquiring about your opening for Assistant Principal at River Tech and would love to be considered for the position. I believe I have the necessary compassion and leadership skills to excel at such an opportunity. My experiences and skills align perfectly with what would be required of me at River Tech.
My teaching experience began as a graduate assistant at Green Valley State. There, balancing my own schoolwork with teaching, I learned to appreciate both sides of the student dynamic. Students often take teachers for granted, and teachers often expect too much or predict too little of their students. Being able to witness both sides simultaneously was a real benefit to my growth.
Upon graduating, I accepted a teaching job at Crane & Jenkins where I was able to hone my abilities in the classroom, working with a class load of nearly 120 students my first year. For the next five years, I continued this work, not only serving as an English teacher but also organizing numerous school clubs and organizations like Best Buddies and 4-H.
While working at Crane & Jenkins, I would also arrange events and meetings at the school, working as a liaison between students, faculty, and parents. Working with the teachers and the students is what I want to continue to do. I am also fond of what I have read about River Tech. The size of the student body, as well as the campus itself, feels perfect for what the staff is able to accomplish.
