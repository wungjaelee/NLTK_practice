Dear Hiring Manager,

It is with great pleasure that I’m applying for the Residential Assistant position at Cloud Clearwater Residence Hall. I have been involved with the Residence Life Community for the past two years. In that time, I have served on a student advisory board that helped create and implement community rules, and we brainstormed potential design features for the newly-constructed Crane & Jenkins Residence Community. This year, I am serving in a leadership role on my residence hall’s executive board. In the time that I have served, my executive board and I have partnered with three different organizations in town to provide food for the homeless and volunteer opportunities for residents.
I work well independently and as part of a team. I am also a strong leader who is able to clearly and effectively communicate timelines, budgets and the goals of community events. I have been praised for my ability to communicate with individuals and identify their needs. I have served as an adviser for some of the smaller committees under the executive board, and I am able to empathize with and address their concerns.
As a Residential Assistant, I look forward to further developing my abilities to make connections with residents while creating engaging community activities. As a means of developing environments that encouraged community at my most recent position, I organized highly successful and well-attended weekly activities, such as game nights, craft nights and movie nights.
I look forward to the opportunity to bring my creativity, empathy and leadership skills to the Cloud Clearwater Residence Hall. I also want to thank you for your time and consideration.
