Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Legal Assistant position at River Tech. As a dedicated and highly skilled legal professional, I have a passion for combining meticulous research and creative problem-solving to produce successful legal outcomes for clients. I have served a wide variety of corporate and nonprofit organizations, and I am thrilled at the opportunity to make a positive impact in the community at River Tech, a leader in legal services for 501(c)(3) organizations.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I had the opportunity to work with senior partners and do legal research, conduct client interviews and create case documents, including legal complaints, summons, and deposition summaries. I was also responsible for handling interactions with district attorneys, opposing council, judges, and court officials to establish collaborative relationships and open lines of communication.
With more than eight years of experience as a legal assistant, I am sensitive to the need for demonstrating the highest levels of integrity and maintaining strict confidentiality for clients and colleagues alike. Trusted relationships are the heart of any legal practice, and I have received multiple commendations from senior leadership for my ability to foster long-term, high-value client relationships.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more about the Legal Assistant position and River Tech. I’m thrilled by the opportunity to help move the company forward in its operational goals by using my expertise and experience to support the River Tech’s industry-leading legal team.
