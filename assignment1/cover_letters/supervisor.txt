Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Supervisor position at Retail Ocean. As a candidate with several years of experience as a Supervisor, I believe I am well-qualified to meet the needs of your company.
During my 10-year tenure at TradeLot, I was responsible for managing over 100 employees. I supervised opening and closing, addressed customer and employee concerns and approved time sheets and paid time off. I used a professional but approachable demeanor with my employees. I encouraged them to ask questions if they were unclear on anything and made it a priority to resolve issues as soon as possible. I developed a personal but professional relationship with each of my employees. As many of them were high school and college students, they looked to me as a mentor. When TradeLot closed, I helped many of them find a new job. I believe that developing a strong relationship with employees makes them more productive and responsible.
My professional skills are rooted in my education from Coral Springs University. I studied Business Administration and studied many topics relevant to business and management. I find it very rewarding to be a major player in the success of a company and the success of the employees I am supervising.
Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward to learning more about Retail Ocean, its products, its employees, and its customers. I am confident that my education and experience will prove me successful as the Supervisor at Retail Ocean.
