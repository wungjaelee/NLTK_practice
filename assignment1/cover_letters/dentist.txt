Dear Hiring Manager,

I noticed the opening you have for a Dentist at Cloud Clearwater, and I am highly interested in the position. I believe my past experiences and personal skills would translate wonderfully to the opportunity within your organization.
I obtain great joy by helping people get healthy and stay safe. Dentistry allows me to do this while utilizing some of my best skills as a worker. In addition, my attention to detail and organizational acumen would make me a vital addition to Cloud Clearwater. I attended university at Hawaii Western to earn my dental degree. The time was extensive but worth every second. The program opened my eyes to what type of work ethic and desire is needed to succeed in this industry. Rather than scaring me away, it enticed me to work even harder to reach my goals.
After school, I began the process of immersing myself in the dental industry. I found assistant work at Crane & Jenkins. Though just a young pup in the field, I could tell that this position would (and did) help a great deal. I learned the ins and outs of day-to-day operations at a dental office. This included interacting with prospective as well as current clients. I fine-tuned my bedside manner and, of course, sat at the hip of the dentist in residency.
Since assistant work was hardly my end goal, I had to move on. But it wasnâ€™t without reservation. I enjoyed my time at Crane & Jenkins and will remember a number of the clients rather fondly. Building relationships is one of my main draws to the profession.
