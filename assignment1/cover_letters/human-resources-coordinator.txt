Dear Hiring Manager,

I am interested in the Human Resources Coordinator position for Cloud Clearwater and the opportunity it provides to design e-learning resources for employee training and development. In my current role, my primary duties include guiding employees through the benefits sign-up process and ensuring that they follow through with evaluating and making changes to insurance benefits during the open enrollment period. Recently, I developed five e-learning modules that employees can access online to review their benefit options during the open enrollment period.
The modules have been very helpful because employees can now review benefits carefully before they make decisions about changes or additions. Employees and family members can access the modules anytime. Prior to my developing this online presentation, employees were required to attend face-to-face benefits updates during the workday, prior to beginning work, or after hours.
Upper management and my Human Resources Manager have been supportive and recognize that using technology is an efficient way to reach employees with important information. However, with limited staff, the company is unable to create a position specifically for this task. In fact, when I developed the modules, I did most of the work after hours during personal time.
Based on what I know about your company, my ability to develop high-quality e-learning resources would be an asset. I have worked for five years in my current position, so I bring knowledge of many areas related to human resources, including interviewing, coordinating benefits, orienting new employees and writing articles for the company newsletter. I look forward to the opportunity to meet you and to discuss how I can design e-learning resources that will benefit the employees at Cloud Clearwater.
