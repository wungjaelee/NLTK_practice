Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Veterinary Technician position at Retail Ocean Clinic. I am a certified Veterinary Technician with more than 10 years’ experience working at a veterinary clinic as well as a lifetime of caring for animals while growing up on a farm. I am excited about the prospect of working at Retail Ocean and having the opportunity to work with small and large animals.
I earned an associate’s degree in veterinary technology from Longford Tech, graduating with a GPA of 3.88, and obtained certification through the American Association of Veterinary State Boards. I began working at River Tech as a Veterinary Assistant while still in college to gain additional training. Upon graduation, I was awarded the position of Veterinary Technician and have worked there since 2007. While I enjoy working at River Tech, it’s a small-animal hospital, and I aspire to advance my training and work with small and large animals.
As part of my responsibilities, I assist in performing lab procedures, examinations and vaccinations. I’m trained and experienced in taking X-rays and safely and gently restraining animals. I contribute to maintaining a clean and organized clinic. I also assist the front desk with administrative duties when needed. I try to provide the animals with love and attention while reassuring their owners that their pets are receiving the best of care. I believe the veterinary experience should be as pleasant and stress-free as possible for both the animal and owner.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I believe my training, experience, compassion and love for animals will make me an asset to your company, and I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your clinic.
