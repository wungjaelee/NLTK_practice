To Whom It May Concern,

Upon noticing the opening for Preschool Teacher at Cloud Clearwater, I was compelled to apply. I feel as though I would be a valuable asset to the program and would love to come on board. Teaching young children has always been my passion, and Cloud Clearwater feels like the right fit for me.
Though I am new to the teaching profession, I have spent my life preparing for such a career. The desire to help children stems from the jobs I had growing up including babysitter, camp counselor, and nanny. I enjoyed everything about the process of watching, teaching, and helping children. Their wonder-filled eyes and minds are meant to be shaped and aided. There is nothing more rewarding than doing just that.
In addition to my work experience, my education makes me an excellent candidate for the job. I earned my B.A. in early childhood education at Hawaii Western, and I minored in childhood development. While there, I served at my local church as a Sunday School teacher for fourth and fifth graders.
I have experience working as an assistant in the classroom. It was just the start I needed for this next jump. At the school, I was responsible for designing fun and engaging projects for the kids. This included making a game of learning letters and numbers. We gave backstories and identities to each symbol to ingrain them in the childrenâ€™s minds. It was a fun take on the preschool lexicon, one that I hope to continue at Cloud Clearwater.
