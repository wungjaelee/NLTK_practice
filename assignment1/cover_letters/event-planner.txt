Dear Hiring Manager,

Sometimes, I flash back to when I was the 10-year-old planning and executing tea parties for my dolls in a princess dress. In fact, that’s how I know I would be a great addition to the Crane & Jenkins team! I’m thrilled to be applying for the Event Planner position at Crane & Jenkins. I believe my attention to detail paired with my sense of creativity and a positive spirit makes me the ideal candidate for your Event Planner opening.
While working as the Assistant to the Event Planner for Cloud Clearwater, I have aided the Event Planner with everything from testing color swatches to arranging guest lists and making late-night pots of coffee to keep us going right before the “Big Event.” At Cloud Clearwater, we aim to curate the best events possible no matter the size, and I, along with the Event Planner, spend hours on end ensuring our clients’ dream events go over without a hitch.
Over the past six months at Cloud Clearwater, I have spearheaded the planning and execution of three large events and two small events while still assisting the Event Manager as she oversees the planning for our larger clients. My time at Cloud Clearwater has been eye-opening, and it has given me precious insight that I am confident I will be able to extend to the Event Planner position at Crane & Jenkins.
Thank you so much for your time and consideration. I’m certain my unique point of view, meticulousness and ability to work under pressure will make me an asset to your team. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about the Event Planner opening. I can be reached at either ihaddington@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
