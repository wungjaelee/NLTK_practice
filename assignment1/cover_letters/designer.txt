Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Designer position at Cloud Clearwater as an exceptional designer with a background in marketing, I understand the impact that good design can have on sales. My recent job experience and education makes me confident in applying for this position.
During my previous role as Designer at River Tech, I used a variety of software and concepts to create creative, innovative, and original package designs for the brand. I am an Adobe Illustrator Certified Expert. I have always had an eye for the way things do and don’t fit together. Throughout my childhood, I can recall many instances where I redesigned packages by hand-drawing. I was a very creative child. This creativity carried me in my role at River Tech. Other members of the team often came to me for advice on their designs. Due to my excellent communication skills, I was able to deliver feedback in a positive light that didn’t demean the design or the designer in any way. I pride myself on my kindness and honesty when critiquing others and their work.
My education at Longford Tech gave me the design and marketing knowledge that furthered my career as a designer. I obtained a degree in graphic design with a minor in marketing. I learned about the elements of art, color theory, painting, sculpting, branding, and business administration. I created original pieces by hand and through design software during my academic career.
Thank you for your consideration of me as a candidate for the Designer position at Cloud Clearwater. I look forward to hearing more about the position and the company.
