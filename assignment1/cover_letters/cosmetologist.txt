Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is Ebony Moore, and I am excited by the opportunity to be a Cosmetologist for Crane & Jenkins Hair Salon. I am a highly skilled stylist who pays a lot of attention to detail so that I can achieve picture-perfect hairstyles. Crane & Jenkins Hair Salon is a leader in the cosmetology industry, and I would be honored to contribute my expertise to a hair salon that has such a stellar reputation.
During my employment at Cloud Clearwater Hair Studios, I was Lead Stylist and worked hard to promote a positive image throughout the hair studios. While working at Cloud Clearwater Hair Studios, I helped to increase the client database by 32% within a 12-month span. I was sure to always be a shining example of a dedicated, professional stylist in order to boost the company’s image and the styling team’s morale.
I received my cosmetology degree from Longford Technical Career School in 2004. I graduated at the top of my class, and I gave back to my community by volunteering to style the hair of women and children at the local women’s shelter. As my experience grew, so did my list of clients. During my previous employment, I styled the hair of many prominent figures, including Sofia Flores, a popular A-list actress, and Ivy Haddington, a famous public speaker.
I appreciate your time and consideration of my application. I am eager to put my passion and skills to use with Crane & Jenkins Hair Salon, and I look forward to telling you more about what I have to offer.
