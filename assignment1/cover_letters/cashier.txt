Dear Hiring Manager,

It is a pleasure to be applying for the Cashier position at Retail Ocean. I believe my years of experience as a cashier and passion for healthy living will prove me a great candidate as a cashier at Retail Ocean. I admire the company’s commitment to providing consumers with healthful, whole products that will increase their quality and length of life.
As a young candidate, I have high energy and an eagerness to learn. During my tenure at my local farmers’ market, I worked for hours on my feet while attending high school full-time, keeping up with my grades, and being involved in several sports. I enjoyed working with the fresh produce and doing a job where I could be active.
I am currently attending Coral Springs University and studying chiropractic care with a minor in alternative medicine. I am a firm believer in the healing power of a whole-food, organic, and plant-based diet. My parents taught me the value of health and always said that “health is wealth.” I come from a very active, hardworking family. My father is a personal trainer and my mother is a florist. My upbringing lit a fire inside of me to be successful and to be healthy. I strongly believe that a healthy body is more efficient and can produce better results at school, on the field, and at work.
Thank you for reviewing my application for the Cashier position at Retail Ocean. I am confident that my high energy, optimal health, and background with plant-based and whole foods will make me a valuable team player at your company. I look forward to learning more about Retail Ocean.
