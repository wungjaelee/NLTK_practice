Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to be applying for the Security position at River Tech. As a military veteran with years of security experience, I am confident in my ability to provide excellent security services for River Tech.
During my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for protecting the people and the property of the company. Each day I performed a morning and evening inspection of the premises. It was my duty to report any suspicious activity, and I avidly removed trespassers from company property. I also did preventative maintenance and open and closed the building. I monitored hallways and conference rooms onscreen from the security office.
As a Marine Corps veteran, I understand the importance of safety. In the Marine Corps, safety was especially stressed when handling firearms. I am well-trained in gun safety, which I believe to be a vital part of an armed security guardâ€™s job. I also believe in the importance of physical fitness as a security guard. I have made it a priority to keep up with my physical training so that I can perform efficiently in case of an emergency. I am a graduate of the Marine Corps Police Academy, which produces highly qualified individuals to protect the Corps and civilians.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about River Tech. I am confident that my background and experience, along with my desire to protect others, will prove me successful in the Security position.
