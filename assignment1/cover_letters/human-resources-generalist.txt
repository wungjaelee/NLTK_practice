Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Human Resources Generalist position at River Tech. As an experienced HR Generalist, I understand the importance of providing great customer service and accurate information to the employees of a company.
At my previous role at Crane & Jenkins, I was responsible for providing employees with information about their benefits. I am knowledgeable about health spending accounts, flexible spending accounts, Cobra, and health insurance policies. I was also responsible for analyzing data, clarifying issues between managers and employees, complying with EEO policies, and keeping a seal of confidentiality. I prided myself in providing excellent customer service to managers and employees. I became efficient at prioritizing tasks and knowing when to escalate issues.
I studied Human Resources Management at Coral Springs University. Throughout my education, I learned about topics such as labor relations, management, organizational culture, employment laws, and global human resources management. I feel strongly that my education provided me with the knowledge necessary to succeed as a Human Resources Generalist. I have a desire to help others succeed, and I see that as a primary goal of human resources. It brings me joy to help employees resolve issues quickly so that they can move forward in their job and be able to provide for their family.
Thank you for the consideration of my application. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and its employees.
