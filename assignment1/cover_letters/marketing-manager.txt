Dear Hiring Manager,

I am very excited to apply for the Marketing Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. I find great satisfaction in helping others create and enhance their brands. As a people-pleaser, I will not rest until every client is content with their results. After working in marketing and advertising for over seven years, Iâ€™m ready to take my career to the next level at Cloud Clearwater.
I have spent the last five years as a brand manager at Crane & Jenkins. I oversee the creation and development of logos, digital and print ads and other client-facing marketing materials, all while tending to the needs of the client. I often work with upward of five clients at a time, which gives me valuable experience in prioritization and organization. My responsibilities include coordinating meetings and project deadlines as well as managing a production team.
The position at Crane & Jenkins allowed me to develop a keen eye for detail when collaborating with graphic designers and copywriters. Earlier in my career, I worked as a graphic designer, so I am also capable of providing assistance and guidance to any creatives I work with when developing a brand. Client satisfaction is always my top priority, and I am willing to put in the time and effort it takes to achieve whatever goals they have set.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and review my resume. I look forward to further discussing this position with you. I am confident that my skills make me a fitting candidate for the Marketing Manager position at Cloud Clearwater, and I am excited to move forward in the hiring process.
