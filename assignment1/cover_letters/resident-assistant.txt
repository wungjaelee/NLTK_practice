Dear Director of Housing,

I am applying for a Resident Assistant position at Coral Springs University. As a rising junior, I am excited to take on an on-campus position. I am not only honest, caring, helpful and friendly, but I can manage conflict as well. I like planning fun activities and get satisfaction out of assisting others. Using these skills, I am ecstatic about the prospect of helping other students by becoming a Resident Assistant at my home away from home.
I recently was a team lead at Retail Ocean. I maintained a positive attitude and helped boost store sales by 5% in addition to serving as a contact person between the associates and managers. During my shifts, I assisted with staff training, solved conflicts, and answered any questions associates had. I used my interpersonal and organizational skills to keep both customers and employees satisfied while building my skills as a trustworthy colleague and dependable leader.
I have experience with both being a leader and being led. Due to this, I can empathize with a variety of different people and work well with others. At Retail Ocean, I effectively trained and mentored 60% more associates in a month than any other Team Lead in the storeâ€™s history. I have seen the value of living in the dorms, and I want to help others have a positive experience living in campus housing.
My resume is attached. I look forward to hearing from you about the Resident Assistant position at Coral Springs University. Experiences that allow me to become a better leader are important as I transition into the professional world. I hope to hear from you soon.
