Dear Hiring Manager,

Once upon a time, my mom thought she lost me in the library, but I was actually hiding in the stacks, organizing the books in a dusty corner of the Green Valley State Library. Naturally, when I saw this job posting, I was thrilled to apply for the Library Assistant opening at Cloud Clearwater. I would love nothing more than to channel my near-obsessive love for organization and books to this position.
While I have no direct work experience in the library science field, I have volunteered as the Library Assistant for Ms. Jenkins, the librarian at my high school, since I was in the eighth grade. For the most part, my job was to reshelve books, so I became very accustomed to the Dewey Decimal System as a point of interest and a necessity. Not only that but I also aided Ms. Jenkins in a complete revamp of our library’s technological system that, before our intervention, hadn’t been updated since the 90s, so I understand the databases and skills necessary to logically work in a library setting.
I am confident that I am ready to take the next step in my journey to librarianship. I am comfortable with teaching patrons new research methods and helping book seekers use the catalog, and I am excited to start a new phase in my life as not only a Library Assistant but also as a lover of books, libraries, and everything in between.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon to set up an interview. I can be reached at either ihaddington@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
