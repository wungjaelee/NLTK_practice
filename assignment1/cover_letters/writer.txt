Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Writer position at River Tech. As a qualified writer with three years of technical, analytical, and copywriting experience, I enjoy working on a variety of projects. Pushing myself as a writer has always been important to me, and I know that at River Tech, I’ll have the opportunity to grow and expand my skills while creating quality content for your team.
During my time at Hawaii Western, I majored in English with an emphasis in Business Writing. This enabled me to focus on developing my technical writing skills. In fact, I was able to present my thesis not only at Hawaii Western but at a local conference as well. This assisted me not only in developing my writing abilities but in helping me hone my public speaking skills.
My previous position at Cloud Clearwater provided me with an incredible opportunity. I was able to revamp our company’s internal memo system to reflect updated verbiage and wording. Additionally, I participated in creating social media and digital platform content for the organization. This helped expand our social media following by over 50% in just three months.
Thank you for your time and consideration. As someone who is detail-oriented, driven, and dedicated to creating fantastic work, I’m looking forward to learning more about the Writer position at River Tech. Quality content creation is one of the most important things to me, and I know that as a writer on your team, I will have the opportunity to create interesting and memorable projects our clients will love.
