Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Custodian position at Crane and Jenkins. As a life-long Custodian, I believe that my advanced knowledge of cleaning and maintenance procedures makes me a great candidate for this position.
During my 30-year tenure as a Custodian at River Tech, I became efficient at cleaning large spaces in a short amount of time. While I can work quickly, I have an eye for detail and I make sure that the space is pristine before moving on to the next area. I have experience using all manner of corrosive and non-corrosive cleaning supplies, and I’m capable of lifting objects up to 75 pounds. I understand the value of a clean office and how it can affect a client’s opinion of the company. As a Custodian, I feel like I am setting the stage for the company’s success, silently working behind the scenes to create a beautiful setting.
My considerable skill set goes far beyond cleaning. Recognizing the importance of administrative skills in this line of work, I have spent years honing my organizational abilities. At my previous job, my responsibilities included scheduling, planning, record-keeping, and taking inventory of supplies. I am well-versed in all aspects of Microsoft Office, including Excel, and my attention to detail is impeccable.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane and Jenkins and the expectations of the Custodian.
