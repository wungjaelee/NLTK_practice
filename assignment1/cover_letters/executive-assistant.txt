Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Executive Assistant position at River Tech. It’s clear that you’re looking for someone who understands the nuances of managing a CEO’s busy day and can proactively tackle issues. As someone with a sharp eye for detail and a drive to organize, I thrive on making sure every day has a clear plan and every plan is clearly communicated.
During my previous role at Cloud Clearwater, I served as the assistant to three of the company’s five executive team members, including the CEO. I was praised for my time management skills, writing abilities, and commitment to excellence. I was publicly recognized at the company’s annual meeting for rapidly developing and enacting contingency plans during the hurricane evacuation, which allowed our executive team to continue to operate business as usual during the crisis.
From my 12 years of experience as an executive assistant, I understand the importance of being proactive. In addition to being an expert at scheduling meetings, preparing agendas, and managing travel arrangements, I’ve also developed the ability to anticipate roadblocks and create effective alternative plans. My greatest value to any executive is my ability to work independently, freeing up their time to focus on the needs of the business.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Executive Assistant position at River Tech. I am excited about the opportunity to work with one of our area’s leading technology firms, and I’m looking forward to demonstrating how I can help make the lives of your company executives easier.
