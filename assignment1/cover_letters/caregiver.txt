Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Caregiver position at Crane & Jenkins. As a highly empathetic and caring individual with extensive experience in the caregiving field, I am confident that I can succeed as a Caregiver at Crane & Jenkins, a trusted name in geriatric care since 1990.
During my tenure at River Tech, I provided home health care for a rotation of 10 patients per week, five days a week. My responsibilities included light housework, giving baths, preparing small snacks, reading to patients, helping them around the house, helping patients use the restroom, providing companionship, keeping track of appointments, and feeding patients. I am very passionate about the well-being of my patients. I believe that the elderly are a valuable and important generation, full of wisdom and knowledge and that they need to be cared for and protected.
During my teenage years, I served as a primary caregiver for my grandmother. As a frail woman in her late 90s, she needed a lot of assistance with most day-to-day functions. Since I was there more than my parents, who both worked full-time, I took it upon myself to be her caregiver. The more time I spent with her, the more I realized that although her body may not function, her mind was an ocean of stories and wisdom, waiting to be explored. I will always cherish the time I had with her and the things she taught me.
I would like to thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about Crane & Jenkins and the expectations of the Caregiver role.
