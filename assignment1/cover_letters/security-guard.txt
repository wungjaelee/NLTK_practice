To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing in regard to the opening I saw for Security Guard at Retail Ocean. Your company seems like an exciting and challenging place to work, and I know I would fit right in. Thanks to my protective nature and past work experience, I would be a perfect fit for your Security Guard position.
My career began soon after high school. I attended Longford Tech, and upon graduation, I transitioned into the workforce. I worked at TradeLot as a maintenance assistant for five years. This was time well spent. Not only did I learn the ins and outs of professional life, but I also gained valuable knowledge of what it meant to be responsible and accountable.
From maintenance work, I moved on to Coral Springs University. I was working for the facilities department, and this proved to be a tremendous experience. The facilities department at a university is responsible for so many critical tasks: upkeep of the buildings, preparation and cleanup after events, and security of facilities and personnel. It was a broad-reaching and educational growth experience.
Being a Security Guard at Retail Ocean combines a number of the factors I am looking for in a career. I enjoy the process and efficiency of securing a building, either overnight or during an event. A qualified Security Guard must serve as an impenetrable line of protection for the company, and I am more than up to the task. I am an open person with a friendly demeanor, but I have keen instincts and pay impeccable attention to detail. I will remain committed to ensuring that your business remains secure but also a welcoming environment.
