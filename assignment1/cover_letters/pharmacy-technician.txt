Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the position of Pharmacy Technician with Cloud Clearwater. As a detail-oriented and attentive person, I would love to have the opportunity to work with your company to provide excellent customer care. One of the most important qualities of any good Pharmacy Technician is the ability to work quickly and precisely. With my excellent attention to detail, I believe I’ll be a perfect fit.
During my previous position at Retail Ocean, I assisted the in-house Pharmacist with filling and distributing prescriptions. My duties included verifying insurance information for patients as well as answering billing questions and concerns. I have a Pharmacy Technician Certificate, and as part of my training program, I developed the skills necessary to help patients acquire the prescriptions they need. I also understand the importance of keeping precise inventory, managing in-house shelves, and keeping things organized.
I also have strong leadership and customer service skills. During my time at Retail Ocean, I was responsible for training four other employees. I also was able to effectively handle customer complaints, questions, and billing disputes in a way that was meaningful and effective for everyone involved.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to hearing more about the Pharmacy Technician position at Cloud Clearwater. Customer service and satisfaction is one of the most important things to me, and I know that at Cloud Clearwater, I’ll be able to help make sure each patient walks away feeling cared for.
