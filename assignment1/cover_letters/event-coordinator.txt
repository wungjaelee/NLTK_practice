Dear Hiring Manager,

I was informed of your opening for Event Coordinator at TradeLot and knew I must apply. This position lines up perfectly with my skills, experiences, and goals for the future. I previously attended Hawaii Western, earning my degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. By working through real-world examples, we learned the ins and outs of many customer-focused businesses. Side work also gave me a solid background in finance and honed my organizational skills.
It wasn’t enough to learn about customer service, though. I had to experience that for myself. After graduating, I became a Facilities and Events Assistant at Coral Springs University. There, I gained the entire blueprint of what an Event Coordinator is all about.
Coordinating an event is about more than renting out a space. A room must be prepped. It must be organized and set up to the specifications of the client. Events must be monitored throughout. And when the event wraps, a coordinator’s job is not done. There is follow-up that must be adhered to. Though CSU was not hosting events as a for-profit enterprise, our department still worked through each step of the process.
From CSU, I moved onto Cloud Clearwater Inn. This gave me personal knowledge of what happens when we are using it as a profit generator. It was yet another side of being an Event Coordinator. My hope to appease the client and do my best to adhere to their desires is what will make me a perfect fit at TradeLot.
