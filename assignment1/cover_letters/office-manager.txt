Dear Hiring Manager,

Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Office Manager position at Cloud Clearwater. I am confident that I’m a great fit for this role. With more than 10 years of experience as an Office Manager for a busy legal firm, I am adept at handling the demands of a fast-paced work environment while maintaining the highest standards of quality.
As an Office Manager at River Tech, I supervised a team of more than 15 employees and coordinated all office activities for two separate branches. I was responsible for selecting and implementing a new office-management system that eliminated the previous labor-intensive paper filing system and improved communication speeds by up to 60%.
Some of the most crucial aspects of being a successful Office Manager are anticipating the needs of the executive team and handling sensitive situations with tact and discretion. I was commended by my manager for my unique ability to read and appropriately respond to nonverbal communication from both colleagues and clients. As a result of this talent, I was invited to serve as a trusted assistant to two of our firm’s senior partners, and I managed the back-office administration of their direct reports.
I would welcome the chance to meet with you to learn more about the Office Manager position and Cloud Clearwater. I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and look forward to speaking with you again about how my skills can benefit Cloud Clearwater’s office operations.
