Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Management Consultant position at River Tech. As a well-educated and highly qualified candidate, I know I can bring dedication and results to River Tech.
During my previous role as a Management Consultant at Retail Ocean, my responsibilities included performing research and collecting data, interviewing my clients’ employees, stakeholders, and managers, facilitating focus groups and workshops, formulating presentations and proposals, presenting recommendations to the client, and maintaining open and clear communication with the client. Over the course of my five-year tenure, I helped over 200 clients in the United States, United Kingdom, and France. During my career, I have helped clients implement improved management strategies that have boosted company morale and increased sales. I strive to create a long-term relationship with each client.
My bachelor’s degree in business from Coral Springs University has proved to be invaluable during my career as a Management Consultant. My studies in business management, marketing, economics, finance, human resources management, accounting, and organization theory provided me with the knowledge I needed to be successful in this field. During my academic career, I grew my knowledge and my character. I gained valuable communication and time management skills. I pride myself in my ability to produce stellar work in a short period of time.
Thank you for your time and consideration of me as a candidate for the Management Consultant role. I look forward to learning more about River Tech and its clients.
