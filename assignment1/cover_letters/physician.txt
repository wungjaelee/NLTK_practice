Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Physician role at Crane & Jenkins, the leading name in children’s healthcare. As a caring, compassionate, and experienced candidate, I am confident in my ability to succeed as a Physician at Crane & Jenkins.
During my previous role at River Tech, I regularly cared for 800 patients. I was responsible for accurately taking down the patient’s medical history, updating their charts and information, ordering tests, reviewing tests for abnormal findings, designing treatment plans, answering patients’ questions, and going over proper nutrition. I treated each of my patients with special attention and care. I strive to be humble in my practice and I try not to jump to conclusions too quickly. I like to keep in mind that there is always more to learn. It is very rewarding to see someone be healed after being treated for a long time. It brings me an indescribable joy.
My education serves as the foundation for my success in the medical field. As a proud graduate of Longford Tech, I believe that my extensive education served me well. Throughout my academic career I intensely studied human physiology, immunology, medical ethics, pathology, and pharmacology. I also completed coursework involving biology, cell biology, biochemistry, microbiology, and molecular biology. I feel that my education further ignited my passion for the medical field and assisted in molding me into the person I am today. I would define myself as someone with a desire to learn who has a listening ear and exceptional communication skills.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about Crane & Jenkins and its patients.
