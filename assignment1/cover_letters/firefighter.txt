To Whom It May Concern,

Many little boys and girls dream of becoming a Firefighter when they grow up. Rather than dreaming it so, I made it so and would love to continue the course of my career with the Crane & Jenkins company. I read about your opening for a new Firefighter and would be elated to join up. I feel strongly that my skills and experience would be a perfect match.
My dream of becoming a Firefighter didn’t materialize out of nowhere. I actually began my service life as a Police Officer, albeit briefly. I attended police academy at Green Valley State, eventually passing and joining the force in town. The job wasn’t what I was best at, though. Instead, firefighting was where my heart was. From the academy, I spent time as a volunteer fireman.
There are similarities between the careers. Both highlight my desire to serve and protect my community. Both require physical, mental, and emotional strength. These are all key aspects of my personality. I perform well under pressure and seem to rise to the occasion when there is a life to be saved.
Combining my desire into a career is the outcome for which I was destined. Obtaining this position would be a dream, but it would also just be the start. I feel as though I would be a major asset to the Crane & Jenkins company. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to meeting with you to share how I will be a great fit for your team.
