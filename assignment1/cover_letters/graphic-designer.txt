Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to be applying for the Graphic Designer position at Cloud Clearwater. I understand you’re currently adding several new product lines, and I believe my skills provide a significant advantage for creating a successful launch. As someone who is a longtime fan of your products, I’m thrilled at the opportunity to bring my unique style and passion for beachwear to the company.
During my previous role at Retail Ocean, I was responsible for all aspects of designing a new technology product, from package design to marketing collateral. This role provided significant insight into the full product lifecycle, which allowed me to deliver more effective and impactful designs. As a result, product sales exceeded company expectations by 20%, and we earned a 2016 American Package Design Award.
In addition to product design work, I have also expanded my portfolio to include video and animation, which are quickly becoming essential to digital marketing campaigns. I’ve developed a popular YouTube series on creating videos for social media, which showcases both my design skills and my passion for continuing my own education. This series has helped me stay on top of the latest marketing trends and discover innovative ways to develop eye-catching visuals.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I’m looking forward to learning more details about the Graphic Designer position at Cloud Clearwater. I’m eager to meet with you and discuss how I can use my skills to bring a new look to your marketing materials and ultimately increase your product sales.
