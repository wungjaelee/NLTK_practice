Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m excited to apply for the Security Officer position at Retail Ocean. As a state-certified Security Officer, I have the training and credentials required to work and excel as a Security Officer at Retail Ocean. Before obtaining my Security Officer certification, I worked as a retail sales associate at a major department store. That experience has given me a working knowledge of the operations in retail environments. I enjoy helping people feel safe, and I know that customer safety is a top priority at Retail Ocean.
While serving in the United States military, I gained valuable training, skills and experience in security operations. I also had practice in written and verbal communication. One evening, while patrolling my assigned area, I observed two individuals without the proper identification, loading items from a storage unit into a truck. I kept the individuals under surveillance and alerted law enforcement. I was later recognized for being instrumental in their arrest and preventing the theft of $20,000 worth of company supplies. I look forward to using my observation skills as a valuable member of Retail Ocean.
Three years of experience as a military police officer and two years of experience as a retail sales associate provided me with the knowledge necessary to work as a Security Officer at Retail Ocean. I completed the security-officer training program at Longford Tech and became state certified. I also have a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice from Green Valley State. I am accustomed to working shift work, and I’m available to work any shift.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and experience for the position of Security Officer at Retail Ocean.
