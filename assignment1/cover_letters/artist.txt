Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to introduce myself as an applicant for the Artist position at Cloud Clearwater. As a lifelong artist, I am confident in my ability to create expressive and interesting pieces that match the needs of your clientele. Based on my experience and education, I feel that I am well-suited for the Artist position.
Ever since I could hold a pencil, I have been creating works of art. From pencil sketches to pastel drawings to Bob Ross-inspired paintings, I did it all. At a very early age, I knew what I wanted to do with my life. In high school, I took Advanced Placement Art and won several awards. By the time I finished high school, I knew that my area of expertise was painting. The walls of my childhood home are still covered with my paintings.
During my education at Longford Tech I studied art history, design, drawing, color theory, and painting. Throughout college, my work was selected to be in many art shows, including the TradeLot Art Show, one of the biggest shows on the West Coast. My paintings featured a wide range of subjects such as mermaids, people, sailboats, beaches, monuments, plants, and much more. My favorite element to experiment with is color. I enjoy seeing how a colorful painting can add brightness to any room. The most rewarding part of being an artist is seeing the face of the client when they see their finished order.
Thank you for your time and consideration of my application. I look forward to learning about Cloud Clearwater and its clients. I feel that the Artist position will allow me to utilize my well-practiced skills to add value to your company.
