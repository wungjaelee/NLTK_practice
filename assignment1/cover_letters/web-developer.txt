Dear Hiring Manager,

I am pleased to be applying for the Web Developer position at River Tech. My extensive experience with designing and developing websites using C#, Java, and Ruby on Rails matches well with your requirements. In addition, my background with working in large development teams has given me the skills to adjust to the changing dynamics and processes of those environments while meeting scheduled milestones and deliverables.
In my previous experience at Cloud Clearwater, I developed several web-based applications for a project management software client. These cloud-based applications tracked and managed information technology project information for several of the world’s largest financial companies. I was involved in the design and development process for all applications, and I managed enhancement requests after each rollout.
I am a proven team player, which is another important requirement for this position. I was recently voted by my peers to receive Cloud Clearwater’s Distinguished Developer Award for exhibiting ideal teamwork traits, including reliability, good communication, commitment, adaptability, and going above and beyond what is asked. Management also recognized my accomplishments in meeting project deliverable deadlines over 99% of the time, exceeding expectations by 5%.
Thank you for taking the time to review my credentials and accomplishments. I am very passionate about being a competent and contributing team player, and I hope to have the opportunity to discuss my examples in greater detail with you. I look forward to answering your questions and learning more about this position and your development teams.
