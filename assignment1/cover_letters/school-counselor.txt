Dear Hiring Manager,

To change the life of just one child is my wish, and if I can do that, I will feel I have done something. I have spent the past four years at Northwest Vermont University learning how to be the best Counselor I can possibly be, and I am confident that I would excel in the School Counselor position at Crane & Jenkins Academy.
At Northwest, I cultivated my love of human relationships by chartering a peer counseling group for our campus. Being able to help my fellow students get through their day-to-day hardships was an uplifting experience, and through that experience, I was able to learn about several different mental disorders and also about different cultures. Now, I believe I have a stronger understanding of what it is like to give of myself and to help people of all backgrounds.
Most of all, this organization has refreshed my compassion and cleansed my sometimes jaded perspective. It is easy in this day and age to become bogged down by all the bad things happening around the world, but this position has reminded me of just how much good there is. I believe that with the right kind of motivation and support, anyone can make their dreams come true. I truly believe that my experience and my coursework have prepared me to be the best School Counselor that I can be, and I would love for it to be at Crane & Jenkins Academy.
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you. I can be reached at emoore@email.com or (123) 456-7891.
