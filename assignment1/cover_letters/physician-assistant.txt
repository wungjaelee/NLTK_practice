Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Physician Assistant position at Crane & Jenkins. When I graduated from Northwest Vermont University three years ago, I knew that I wanted to work in delivering primary health care services because I believe thatâ€™s where I can have the most impact on the daily lives of people. I am intrigued by the Physician Assistant position you seek to fill at Crane & Jenkins because of the inroads you are making in community health education and improving health outcomes for underserved populations.
With my Physician Assistant role at Cloud Clearwater, I examined, diagnosed, and counseled approximately 60 patients each day. My goal was to appropriately treat any acute conditions while educating my patients and their families to promote comprehensive wellness and maintain chronic illness treatment. To ensure all patient needs were met, I coordinated with the physician and health care staff while making referrals for additional intervention when necessary.
In addition to my strong medical judgment and communication skills, I am adept at learning new technologies. At Cloud Clearwater, I established myself as the in-house expert on the DocuTAP Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. My ability to leverage technology resulted in me meeting our goal of an averaging less than an hour in-office for the patient. As such, my patient satisfaction rating was always 95% or higher.
Thank you for taking the time to review my application, and I appreciate your consideration. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the Physician Assistant position and Crane & Jenkins. I believe my ability to reach patients to help improve their health outcomes will be a benefit to your team and the community you serve.
