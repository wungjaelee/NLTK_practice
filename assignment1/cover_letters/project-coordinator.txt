Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Project Coordinator position at TradeLot. As someone who is motivated by organizing projects to maximum efficiency, I have established myself professionally as the go-to person for getting projects completed on time and under budget. I am intrigued by the Project Coordinator position you seek to fill at TradeLot, a leader in the cloud-based payment processing marketplace. I believe that my skills and interest will add value to your team and customers.
With my previous coordinator role at Cloud Clearwater, I provided administrative support to four project managers and coordinated an average of five concurrent projects each month. I planned and monitored project schedules, budgets, resources, and communication. I have prior experience using several cloud-based project management applications including Asana, Basecamp, and Trello. I specialized in maintaining detailed project documentation, which ensured all project stakeholders were informed of scope, milestones, and deliverables.
While working in Cloud Clearwaterâ€™s fast-paced environment, I excelled at remaining calm under pressure and staying focused on the timely completion of all project milestones. Although I averaged a portfolio of five projects each month, when the other Project Coordinator on my team was out on extended leave, my average project load doubled. I was able to absorb the coordination of those additional projects while maintaining a 98% on-time completion rate.
Thank you for your consideration and for taking the time to review my application. I welcome the opportunity to learn more about the Project Coordinator position and TradeLot. I have brought my considerable skills to my previous roles and I hope to bring them to TradeLot as well.
